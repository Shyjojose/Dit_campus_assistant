scientific communication
Science communication is not science journalism. Of course not. It is the mouthpiece of research at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology (DIT). Nevertheless, our science communication is of course based on research findings. It is evidence-based and committed to maximum transparency. Science communication actively informs the public, acting bi-directionally. This means that it picks up needs, ideas and moods from its environment and tries to integrate them into the university in a meaningful way. The goal is open dialogue with business and society in the region - and beyond. In this dialogue, science communication forms a platform for mutual understanding regarding technical, economic, ecological and social challenges - and their possible solutions. Science communication at DIT includes a wide range of formats for different target groups: Children's university, lectures, DigiCamps, media work, social media, podcasts, personal portraits, open house, Dies academicus and much more. Science communication does not only work in fact. It also wants to touch people emotionally and reach them. Conversely, our formats also want to show the people behind the algorithms, behind the apparatuses, behind the machines. Who they are and what drives them. This is the only way to create credibility and trust - and an appropriate level of participation, which society demands in principle and rightly so in matters of research. A survey conducted by Wissenschaft im Dialog GmbH showed that 64 percent of those surveyed would like to experience how a scientist works, and 57 percent would like to discuss with scientists what is worth researching. Science communication serves as a hub between the two worlds. We work on this every day.

Survey 2009
The graduate survey of 2009 once again confirmed existing insights, but also revealed a significant change:
The majority of graduates of the DIT remain in Bavaria, most of them even in Lower Bavaria, and thus the university continues to be an important pillar of the regional economy as a source of academic talent.
The crisis year 2008 and the associated slump on the job market has prompted many graduates to follow up their bachelor's degree with a master's degree in order to gain even better qualifications, but also to bridge the crisis period in a sensible way. In comparison to previous years, a significant increase can be seen here. The conclusion may be drawn that the crisis has helped to establish Master's programs in general.
In terms of starting salaries, a comparison with previous surveys shows consistently good pay, especially for engineers. It is pleasing that the noticeable discrepancy in salaries between the sexes has decreased.

The DIT alumni year
DIT's alumni work has a different focus each month:
Test a Coach
A new offer from the alumni office to alumni is the Test a Coach program.
We want to offer young (in the sense of 'new to the business') alumni who have just started their own coaching business, or who are in the process of doing so, the opportunity to gain their first coaching experience. On the other hand, there are alumni who would like to have coaching, but are still afraid of the costs and effort involved.
The coachees can choose their subject area in advance and evaluate the coaching afterwards using a questionnaire.
Get in touch with us to be part of the Test a Coach program starting in the winter semester 2024:
Are you a coach (and former DIT student) and interested in offering trial coaching sessions for DIT alumni?
Then please send us an email with your profile and portfolio to alumninet@th-deg.de
Are you a alumni of DIT and interested in coaching?
Please send us an email with some information about your goals to alumninet@th-deg.de

Applied Computer Science

Career Development
After graduating from high school in 2014, I started studying media technology with a focus on computer science at DIT. This gave me a broad knowledge of different media and technical background. Especially the computer science courses were fun. Thus, I decided to specialise in this direction in the Master's programme.
From 2018 to 2020, I completed the Master's in Applied Computer Science / Infotronics. This is structured in English and is a good mix of programming and engineering topics. It also includes freely selectable modules from the Master's programmes in Electrical Engineering and Media Technology. Meanwhile, I took the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Finland.
Immediately after my Master's thesis, which I wrote at BMW in Landshut, I started as an IT trainee at Allianz AG (insurance industry) in Munich. Here I was able to try out different roles (e.g. project manager office, deputy manager or project manager) and get to know the insurance world.
Since April 2022, I have been an IT project manager in the Workplace Team at Allianz Technology. In addition, I now have the chance to accompany our team into agilisation as a product owner.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
I have fond memories of my 6 years in Deggendorf. I like both the city and DIT itself very much. There is a family-like environment from which you can take many friendships with you for life. How often did we sit by the Danube and enjoy the sun?
In addition, you can really savour the student life at night. The beer toss at Spontan with the most delicious fries was always legendary.
But the university also has a lot to offer: I like to think back to the sports programme and the MovING programme for female students.
I still feel very connected to the university through the
AlumniNet
network and like to visit DIT again for one or two seminars.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Enjoy your time as a student, because it goes by far too quickly. Don't put off too many exams, try things out and take as much as you can with you for your life. But don't lose sight of your goal.
For the inquisitive, I can give the tip: Take voluntary AWP language courses and career service seminars. I personally found Business Etiquette the best, but it was always booked up quickly. You can also find some seminars on soft skills here.
If you have the chance to spend a semester abroad, take it. Such experiences are worth their weight in gold.

Career Development
I already had 2 different jobs before I started my studies, as I had completed an apprenticeship as a businesswoman for office management. During my studies, I was a trainee in Aftersales at the BMW Group in Munich.
I took business administration with a focus on marketing & sales. After my studies, I worked for the first time in Influencer Marketing at a start-up in Berlin and have now been working for over a year as a Social Media Manager at one of the largest IT companies in the world and am currently even working at European level.
What I would like to emphasise here: I haven't lived in Germany for 3 years. I ended up in Portugal because of Covid and started working with the German team from here, only recently I was upgraded to Europe level.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
I really enjoyed studying at DIT, especially the fact that I was able to take something from the most diverse fields of business administration, which helps me to this day to have an all-embracing understanding of complex corporate structures.
My professors encouraged me along the way and actively supported me until the end. Especially in Covid times, when I couldn't be on site, they made it possible for me to complete my studies. DIT offers really great opportunities not only locally, but also internationally. The university is very well networked, which not only makes semesters abroad possible, but also participation in events in other countries and universities. In 2019, I had the opportunity to attend the "Global Entrepreneurship Week in Rotterdam" and expand my network and perspective immensely in just one week. Furthermore, in 2020 I also got to do a semester abroad in Budapest, which was mostly online due to Covid, but I still got to take away many new and helpful impressions.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Keep your minds open to all possibilities. A lot of things will be new and you are often still closed to trying new and unknown things. Use your studies to jump over your shadow, as soon as you do that you start to get to know yourself, your possibilities and your strengths. And you get a little closer to your dream job or your dream career. Very few people know from the start where they want to go, so don't be afraid, trust in the unknown and try it out.

Career Development
When I graduated, I was lucky to have a job lined up for me and ended up in Talent Management which is the fancy term for Recruiting. It's a long story on how this was possible but of course relevant to everything I'm writing here.
My first internship was in Recruiting at FlixBus in Munich. I initially wanted to land an internship in Marketing but was constantly overlooked/rejected as I didn't have any prior experience in the field. Since people and culture were an interest of mine at the time as well, I thought, "hey, let's give this job a try" and it paved the rest of my career for me. Quite literally.
Initially my focus during the internship was to learn as much as possible in hopes that I could transfer anything I learnt in Recruiting into a career in Marketing. But as I finished my first month at FlixBus and was given more responsibilities outside of Recruiting, that was when I discovered Employer Branding, which is the best of both worlds. I was able to create content, go to career fairs and even host events/Stammtisch for the interns in my cohort.
When my internship was about to end, my Manager at the time took notice of me and offered me a Working Student job with them. Which I'm am eternally grateful for as fast-forward 6 months, I ended up in limehome as a Working Student in People and Employer Branding with her when she left FlixBus. After graduation she/they offered me a full time role as a Junior in the company in the same department allowing me to continue building my knowledge in Employer Branding and People.
Then... COVID strook, we all moved to home office and like others this was when the thoughts in my brain started to chatter. Do I want to stay in Recruiting, do I still want to pursue something in Marketing. Don't get me wrong, I was happy at the time at limehome cause my colleagues were great. I was also doing cool tasks like, branding materials for the employees, content for our LinkedIn page and I even got a chance to design the company job site. But something about the many lockdowns just got me thinking.
Fast forward again to 2021, HubSpot found me on LinkedIn and I gave them a shot because like they say, never say never. Which leads to my current role now as a Program Manager. Where I'm no longer recruiting and I'm responsible for university events and partnership. Sharing real life experiences with students like you so that you know what to expect when you graduate. Which was a direction that helped me shift away from recruiting and move more towards Employer Branding.
Moral of the story is, no matter what your major is or what you decide to study, your career can look completely different and do a 360 flip without your consent. Just keep an open mind wherever you end up.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
Something I really enjoyed about studying at DIT is the community you'll have. Being someone who moved to Germany, had to learn German and studied completely in German (mostly Bavarian/bairisch ;) ) , I managed to make a home for myself in Deggendorf during my studies. There were no regrets from my side choosing a German course, as that allowed me to interact with the locals. I was also involved in and did many extracurricular activities which allowed me to mix and mingle with international/exchange students that came to DIT.
I even took advantage of the fact that DIT had many partner universities all around the world and did an exchange semester in Seoul (Kookmin University) where I met friends from all over, the Nordics, US, Canada, and we're still in touch even to this day. Needless to say, I always have a place to stay whenever I travel to these countries which is a huge bonus for me since I love travelling.
Doing a German Bachelors helped me maintain great German speaking skills (yes, I'm patting myself on the back but it's to make a point!) which opened doors for me and helped me land the jobs I mentioned above. Which is why I highly encourage international students who are contemplating between an English or German Course to take a risk and go towards BWL instead of studying IM. It was a struggle for me, even with C1 German but I can promise you, it's worth it if you want a future business career in Germany.
What advice would you give to today's students?
There's always 3 main things I share with students whenever I do my events.
1. Network, network, network: I mean, hey, I'm a shy kiddult (kid addult) too but my statement above already proves why it's important to start networking now and building your community. Be genuine when reaching out to people, don't just connect because you need something. Say hello, congratulate people for their achievements, you never know what doors you could open!
2. Trial and error: Don't be afraid to make mistakes in life. For me, I deal with mistakes and failures by seeing them as learnings. Because without making them, you would never learn and never grow, which is not helpful when it comes to working life or life in general.
3. Follow your passion, not money: Yes, money is important but keep in mind after uni, you'll most likely be working for 40 years or more - in case you're planning to work until retirement of course. You don't want to be stuck doing something you dislike even if it's for good money because trust me when I say, it will drain your soul and your personality - wow that's a bit deep, sorry peeps. If you can find both, way to go you!
And a bonus! - It's never too late to do/start something new. So get off your bottom and flush that fear/concerns away and try something new ;).

Career Development
After the bachelor's degree (dual) with training and employment as a bank clerk (IHK) at Raiffeisenbank Ortenburg-Kirchberg v.W. eG came to an end, I already knew that it was not yet over in terms of studies. Therefore, I decided to pursue the Master's degree in Business Administration - FACT: Finance, Accounting, Controlling, Taxation & Business Law at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. By doing so, I wanted to further develop my methodological and technical knowledge in the commercial areas for my future career path. Because I already enjoyed dealing with both paragraphs and numbers before, this was the right decision. While I was still studying, I also got involved as a trainee and later as a working student at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in the auditing department in Munich and worked, among other things, on the annual financial statements of what used to be the largest DAX company. In my last semester, I completed a semester abroad at the University of Vaasa, Finland. The digital forms of learning there have left a lasting impression on me to this day. After finishing my Master's degree, I started working as a tax assistant at the law firm Wolter & Musselmann Steuerberater Rechtsanwälte. In this area, I am responsible for annual financial statements and tax returns of medium-sized companies and self-employed persons as well as for business management consulting fields. In addition, I am writing my dissertation as an external doctoral student at the chair of ABWL, in particular business taxation of Prof. Dr. Reinald Koch (KU Eichstätt-Ingolstadt).
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
Starting a dual study programme at DIT was one of the best decisions of my life. There I found not only companions but also friends, took part in inspiring events and developed enormously.
My highlight was being able to hold tutorials on investment management and corporate finance for 2nd semester Bachelor students. Lecturing on topics and thus conveying content in a variety of ways is undoubtedly something I will always look back on. It was also through this that I discovered which path was suitable for me. In addition, I worked on an online course on the topic of finance as part of my studies, where we also shot an instructional video in addition to creating digital content. What I wouldn't want to miss during my time as a student is the exchange with fellow students after lectures or in the form of "coffee dates" during breaks, excursions and evening events. Ultimately, it was these moments, the exchange with fellow students, that made studying so worthwhile. I still value the resulting team spirit at DIT very much, which is why I always look back on my time at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology with pleasure.
What advice would you give to today's students?
"Be active, take opportunities and use them to find out what you want to achieve in your life." This is how I would describe an appropriate mindset that may help some during their time at university.
When things don't go so well, it's important not to let setbacks get too close to you and still draw the right conclusions from them so that you can push forward with your further development.
As far as I'm concerned, my professional career would probably look different today if I hadn't studied at DIT and got involved there. I would like to thank the people who accompanied me on my way.

When I think about the common thread that runs through my CV, it is definitely the passion for marketing, developing helpful solutions for people and the opportunity to independently drive topics forward. So in my search for my own projects, I got stuck on the idea of founding a company and every day I‘m excited about the opportunity to be involved in our project with “Little Snooze”. I love our philosophy of making the stressful and noisy world we find ourselves in more pleasant and relaxed for the youngest among us. How we plan to achieve this? Feel free to check out our website :-)
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
I have very fond memories of my time studying at DIT. I particularly appreciated the family atmosphere on campus and the International Office‘s commitment to the students. I can only recommend that everyone take advantage of the opportunities and spend at least one semester abroad. I went abroad twice - for an internship in Spain and for a semester abroad in Scotland. I wouldn‘t trade that experience for anything.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Try out different things, be brave and don‘t let anyone talk you out of or down on your goals. Self-confidence, perseverance and strong intrinsic motivation are.

Career Development
I came to Deggendorf because of the focus on tourism. However, after my compulsory internship, I already realised that I was attracted to logistics. That's why I chose to major in Purchasing and Logistics and Technical Marketing and Sales Management. A perfect combination, as it turned out. To round off my profile, I then decided to do a Master's degree in industrial engineering at KIT. Here I was able to deepen my knowledge in logistics and combine it with my enthusiasm for technology. After various internships and working student jobs in the automotive industry and at Bosch, planning IT systems in intralogistics and material flow automation seemed to be the perfect job for me. Various projects, including again at Bosch and at Zalando, led me to want to go deeper into consulting. The decision was made to get a brief taste of consulting. This idea turned into 7.5 years at Accenture and the intralogistics projects became full scope greenfield SAP S/4HANA transformations in various industries. As the projects grew, so did the responsibility, the team and the career level up to Managing Director.
Currently, I am responsible for the area of supply chain management in IT at Knauf and supported Knauf with my team on the path to digitalisation. It was simply time to leave consulting behind me.

I always enjoyed my time at the DIT. From the cool fellow students to the great events, excursions, trips and factory tours. But especially my time at consult-it! and the preparation for my future professional life. There were already a lot of offers during my time and I always tried to take advantage of everything and was able to take a lot with me. The great mix of theory and practice has created a very important basis for me.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Take advantage of what DIT has to offer, especially if you can exchange ideas with
Alumni
, mentors or professionals. But don't take your career planning too seriously, planning is important, but contacts and a bit of luck are simply part of it.
Thomas Hofbauer
Business Administration (dual)
Thomas Hofbauer still loves to visit the town, which functions as the door to the Bavarian Forest and thinks back to his exciting days as a student with a smile on his face.
Career Development
After graduating from high school, I decided to do a dual course of studies at DIT. In the course of my business administration studies (dual training as Bachelor & Banker) I acquired extensive knowledge of service-specific relationship processes in a regional bank. This also prompted me to develop further in the psychosocial field in addition to my business administration studies, and so I enrolled for a master's degree in business psychology at the FHAM Erding.
At the same time, as head of the e-commerce department at VR-Bank Rottal-Inn eG, I was responsible for the topic of digital sales and innovation and gained a great deal of knowledge in the areas of online marketing, online strategy and social media advertising through my certification as head of online business at the Academy of Bavarian Cooperatives. Since the main focus of my master studies, marketing and coaching, gave me a lot of pleasure, I decided to turn my back on the world of finance and orientate myself elsewhere. Through an assessment centre I acquired the position of deputy press spokesman in the district office of Rottal-Inn and was also responsible for the digital media presence. Since the middle of 2018 I am now office manager of the district administrator of Rottal-Inn. As office manager, I am in charge of the District Administrator's office (e.g. assignment of tasks and personnel management of the employees in the District Administrator's office). As personal assistant to the District Administrator, I am responsible for the coordination of the District Administrator's business and the preparation of appointments for the office management as well as the management function of the management level of the District Administrator's Office. In addition, I coordinate the preparation of the content of the meetings of the District Council and its committees and take part in almost all meetings.

The time of my studies in Deggendorf was legendary, and I still think back often to that time with a smile on my face. The town of Deggendorf is just the right size, it offers the nightlife of a big city, but you feel safe like in a village, everything is within walking distance. The cultural diversity that the campus offers has broadened my horizon immensely and has enabled me to make many intercultural friendships, some of which still last until today. I still enjoy visiting the city, which is the gateway to the Bavarian Forest, and think back to a unique time of study. Does the phenomenal currywurt still exist at Otto's?
What advice would you give to today's students?
The most important thing during the study time is, besides the lectures, self-organisation and a sensible time management to divide the learning material and to use synergy effects by learning together with fellow students. And above all: do not push exams! That will certainly catch up with you. If you do reach your limit, I can only advise you to seek direct contact with the professors. Especially the professors at DIT are not sitting in an ivory tower, but are there for the students when they need them - I have always appreciated that. And last but not least: even if you miss a mark - don't let yourself down, much more important are the contacts and networks, the experiences as well as internships and projects and these can be built up and maintained very well at DIT.

Career Development
In my rather colourful resume, I simply start where I think it might be interesting: After graduating (Quali) I did an apprenticeship as a specialist for employment promotion at the job centre, which made me realise quickly that the job market is not always a walk in the park, but also that I am interested in many other areas in the economic sector and therefore outside the job centre. Therefore, I had no other choice than to bite the bullet and take the technical baccalaureate in Deggendorf. After a short detour to the vocational academy at the discount store Aldi I finally ended up at the TH Deggendorf...and that was a good thing!
I studied technical business administration in Deggendorf from 2005 to 2009, which opened up a quite broad spectrum of professions. My first job after my studies was in the aviation industry at MTU Aero Engines in Munich in technical purchasing. I really enjoyed the daily contact with suppliers in the U.S. and Mexico, with the employees in the highly complex production and with the experienced quality engineers. But at first I was completely blank in terms of content, and my colleagues often heard me say, "What's this metal thing here?
In 2012, it was time to go one step further and I became Global Commodity Manager at BSH (Bosch's home appliances division). There I was responsible for global strategic purchasing for electronics in the small appliances division of the Household Appliances division. As it turned out to be a very exciting and dynamic field, I spent almost five years traveling the world for BSH. Parallel to my job, I trained for over three years in continuing education and completed my NLP Master and NLP Trainer (NLP - Neurolinguistic Programming) in 2017. This resulted in a job at BSH headquarters as a global lean management coach and trainer for indirect areas, where I have been working since July 2017. I help colleagues to question their working methods across cultural boundaries. I offer them methods and techniques to independently create improvements in terms of collaboration, effectiveness and efficiency.

Time... that was something, contrary to today, I had. It was a great time of trial and error and of looking beyond the horizon. Thanks to the various seminars, events and the cool leisure activities offered by the university, you could quickly make contacts and it never got boring. As a semester speaker and member of various university committees, I also had the opportunity to experience more internal affairs. My "job" as a board member of
AlumniNet
e.V. was also very exciting and showed me what it means to keep several balls in the air. Four months of an internship abroad in a small company in Madrid finally brought my Spanish language skills to an acceptable level. Right after the internship my wallet was empty, so that I also worked in marketing at a solar company as a working student. Since I was already used to working, I wrote my diploma thesis at MAN in Munich in the purchasing department and dealt with the optimization of value flows and relocation back to Germany, among other things. After seven semesters I received my diploma in business administration.
What advice would you give to today's students?
For me, studying means trying things out, getting a taste of the topics and above all leaving one's own comfortzone to see what's out there. Be committed and use the time to broaden your horizon professionally, but also personally. What else...hmmm...have fun, enjoy the many opportunities in Deggendorf and make friends (maybe) for life!

In 2009, I graduated in Deggendorf with a degree in business administration (FH), specialising in human resources and marketing. In economically difficult times (economic crisis 2008-2009), it was impossible for newcomers to start a career despite several internships, so I decided to deepen my expertise in human resource management by studying for a Master's degree in Human Resource Management. In 2010, I completed my studies in Regensburg and my practical Master's thesis with the "Introduction of a target agreement and remuneration system for managers" at the company Otto Dunkel GmbH (electrical industry) in Mühldorf a. Inn.
After my studies, I started as a personnel officer at the Schreiner Group in Oberschleißheim near Munich. Here I was responsible for supervising executives in all personnel-related topics. After two and a half years in the printing industry, I moved to the automotive industry to MANN+HUMMEL in Marklkofen. As HR Business Partner and Deputy HR Manager, I was responsible for seven years for supporting and advising executives on all strategic and operational HR topics as well as implementing HR projects. At the end of 2019, I moved to my home town of Mühldorf a. Inn to Belimed GmbH (medical technology), where I was responsible for HR management in Germany as HR manager, authorised signatory and member of the management team. In addition, I was active as a trainer at the Belimed Leadership Academy and supported managers in their development and all daily management challenges in business coaching. Parallel to my job, I am training to become a "Westerhamer Business Coach (IHK)" - one of the most profound and comprehensive trainings in business coaching in Germany.
Since 2022 I have been working as a freelance business and leadership coach. I offer solution-oriented and customised business coaching and training for employees, managers and teams. I support the development and self-reflection of my clients, accompany them in solving problems and try to make possible actions visible, which they can then take into their own hands. I take responsibility for the framework and the process and the client/coachee for their personal goal. I am a sparring partner, feedback provider, active listener, motivator, supporter and temporary process facilitator. What counts for me is to proactively shape the client's development for sustainable success in the company.
I also combine my work as a coach with my second mainstay - I am the owner and manager of a business and event location - the HENNETSBERG near Mühldorf a. Inn. The premises can be rented for conferences, celebrations and weddings and I use them myself for my own workshops, team events and business coaching.

My time as a student in Deggendorf was very formative for my personality and simply a wonderful time with nice friends. I deliberately moved to Deggendorf in 2004 to my first own flat in the new student residence in Schaching. I wanted to concentrate completely on my studies and start a new phase in my life after my Abitur and civilian service. This also made it easier for me to integrate into a new local life. I quickly made connections in various clubs and in life outside of my studies. At the university, I was mainly involved in three areas: As the spokesperson for the scholarship holders of the Hanns Seidel Foundation, I organised various events at and outside the university. As a board member of the alumni association "
AlumniNet
", I was instrumental in building up the alumni network and organising many company visits, such as Daimler in Stuttgart, Trigema in Burladingen or the Allianz Arena in Munich. And as the first chairman of the student convention, I shaped the distribution of student fees at the university together with the student council team. All great experiences in preparation for my professional life.
And of course, there was no shortage of partying and enjoying student life. Whether it was partying in the student pubs, chilling by the Danube or barbecuing on the roof terrace of the shared flat...it was a great time that I look back on with pleasure.
What advice would you give to today's students?
What's always important to me is to try new things, to try things out and to have new experiences. Whether it's in student associations, exchanges with mentors or internships in companies - it's always important to think outside the box and gain new experiences. For example, I spent a semester abroad in Madrid myself, without much knowledge of the language and without other fellow students on site. I picked up the language, made new friends and gained valuable experience for my personal development.
Another great thing is the
Career Service
at DIT. I don't think I missed almost a single seminar that way. 😊 These were just great, valuable tips to prepare for my job entry. And so today, as a trainer myself, I regularly conduct various practical lectures and seminars on the topics of successful studying, application and job entry, time management, mindful & successful living at universities and educational institutions.
And I would like to pass on this experience to the students of today and also be a role model: Show initiative, get involved and have new experiences. But also enjoy the free student life. These insights and developmental steps will shape you for life.

After my graduation (Dipl. BWL) in 2008, I began my professional career as a management consultant. During this time, I quickly realised that I didn't want to give up university life just yet and continued to get involved with lecturing and teaching at various universities. I also participated in the Executive MBA programme at DIT with the Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences during this time.
I was able to gain consulting experience in the automotive and manufacturing industries as well as in the financial industry. The latter led me to choose this as my next career step and I have now been working in various roles at Allianz Global Investors since 2013. In my current role, I am responsible for the complete project portfolio worldwide from early origination to completion of projects. I have also been a lecturer at the International School of Management for several years in the Bachelor's and Master's degree programmes in Leadership & Motivation, Consulting and Project Management.

I have very fond memories of my time in Deggendorf. Not only the experience in the smaller study groups (I was previously at the University of Passau) but also the successes with the DIT football team were formative times. I'm still convinced today that the time spent studying is a time that you should enjoy, because it's also a time when attitudes and values are established that you can draw on and benefit from for a long time. Certainly, I could have invested more in building up a "business" network at that time - honestly, I wasn't aware of the benefits or important enough at the time. That's why even today I still recommend to all students in my courses to use the time to build up their network - you never know when you'll need a contact.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Focus on the things you really enjoy. Focus on your strengths and build on them - these will make the difference at some point.

After graduating from high school in 2014, I started studying media technology with a focus on computer science at DIT. This gave me a broad knowledge of different media and technical background. Especially the computer science courses were fun. Thus, I decided to specialise in this direction in the Master's programme.
From 2018 to 2020, I completed the Master's in Applied Computer Science / Infotronics. This is structured in English and is a good mix of programming and engineering topics. It also includes freely selectable modules from the Master's programmes in Electrical Engineering and Media Technology. Meanwhile, I took the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Finland.
Immediately after my Master's thesis, which I wrote at BMW in Landshut, I started as an IT trainee at Allianz AG (insurance industry) in Munich. Here I was able to try out different roles (e.g. project manager office, deputy manager or project manager) and get to know the insurance world.
Since April 2022, I have been an IT project manager in the Workplace Team at Allianz Technology. In addition, I now have the chance to accompany our team into agilisation as a product owner.

I have fond memories of my 6 years in Deggendorf. I like both the city and DIT itself very much. There is a family-like environment from which you can take many friendships with you for life. How often did we sit by the Danube and enjoy the sun?
In addition, you can really savour the student life at night. The beer toss at Spontan with the most delicious fries was always legendary.
But the university also has a lot to offer: I like to think back to the sports programme and the MovING programme for female students.
I still feel very connected to the university through the AlumniNet network and like to visit DIT again for one or two seminars.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Enjoy your time as a student, because it goes by far too quickly. Don't put off too many exams, try things out and take as much as you can with you for your life. But don't lose sight of your goal.
For the inquisitive, I can give the tip: Take voluntary AWP language courses and career service seminars. I personally found Business Etiquette the best, but it was always booked up quickly. You can also find some seminars on soft skills here.
If you have the chance to spend a semester abroad, take it. Such experiences are worth their weight in gold.

After graduating, I wanted to deepen my growing interest in production and logistics and switched to the master's programme at OTH Regensburg. During my Master's, I was already working at Infineon in the field of production data analysis. After completing my Master's degree, I received an attractive offer to work as a software engineer for data analysis systems at Intel. This was a very exciting experience on many levels: a multifaceted, fast-moving and technically challenging industry, rapidly growing responsibility and promotion, international projects, processes and systems, US corporate philosophy and inspiring colleagues in and from different corners of the world.
In 2015, I joined ams-OSRAM as Project Manager for Production Data Management. I was later promoted to Programme Manager and designed the international introduction of data governance, sponsored by the then COO.Most recently, I was a Senior Manager on the staff of the Vice President of Operations Engineering and was responsible for a range of international programmes in the area of Operational Excellence.Together with the factories in Germany and Asia as well as experts from Product Development to Supply Chain, we developed and established sustainable measures to successfully reduce deviation costs in the value chain.
Parallel to my professional activities, I pursued my academic career. I taught for 8 semesters as a lecturer at the THD, gave guest lectures and completed my Ph.D. at the British University of Gloucestershire in Cheltenham.
I was appointed professor at OTH Amberg-Weiden for the winter semester 2022/23. I focus on data management and quantitative methods in my teaching and research, seamlessly picking up where I left off from 12 years of practical work. I am particularly pleased that I have already been able to win over former colleagues for collaborations!

I look back fondly on my student days. Between the excited hustle and bustle on Freshers' Day and the proud farewell in the Stadthalle, close friendships developed that still exist today. The informal atmosphere at the UAS, which was still small at the time, characterised our student life. Of course, individual professors also influenced my career with their very own style. As a student assistant with Prof. Popp, I got my first glimpse "behind the scenes" and assisted in the creation of e-learning materials (e.g. I programmed the "knowledge navigator" for Moodle, which subsequent years may still remember). And my job as a tutor for databases has fostered both my enthusiasm for the subject matter and for teaching.

After successfully completing my part-time degree in business informatics at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology, I was transferred from the IT control centre of the Bavarian prison system to the State Office of Criminal Investigation. Here I was then employed in the exciting field of IT forensics, especially in mobile phone forensics, among other things as a forensic scientist/expert. During this time, I completed another part-time Master's degree in Computer Science at the FernUni in Hagen. (I would have liked to study at the TH again, but the commute to Deggendorf was too time-consuming for the new office in Munich). In March 2019, I successfully completed my Master's degree and even received two awards for my Master's thesis: 1st place in the Mint Award for IT Security from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and I was one of the five finalists at the award ceremony of the GI specialist group "Women and Computer Science".
During the coronavirus pandemic, I then decided to apply for a management position at FinanzIT Bayern at the Bavarian State Office of Finance. I am still head of the "Test Centre - Focus on Test Automation" department there and am also very involved in the recruitment and retention of employees.

Of course I remember my time studying at DIT and I remember it very fondly. At the beginning, I had a lot of respect and also some fear of studying part-time without an Abitur. After a few lectures, my fear subsided because the professors were able to convey the content of the lectures very well, answered questions at any time and there were lots of learning opportunities. At that time, the degree programme was already about 50% virtual, which is quite normal today. This learning method was relatively new at the time and required a lot of self-discipline. Nevertheless, I always felt well looked after.
In addition to the very good professors, we had a very good "study community" and great friendships were formed, which we still maintain today. For me, my time at DIT was a very important and wonderful time. I don't think I would be in a management position at the Free State of Bavaria today without my time at DIT.
What advice would you give to today's students?
I would like to say to part-time students in particular that you can be proud if you have managed to complete another semester alongside your work. You need stamina, ambition and it often takes a few nerves, but it is very important that you network well with the other students, are not afraid to ask questions and enjoy your studies. Motivate each other, help each other with deficits and learn together!

After I completed my Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics in Deggendorf, I was drawn to nearby Munich. I had a very specific goal in mind: to start my own company. I wanted to find out whether the vision of my own future really suited me - a kind of prototyping for my own career profile.
As usual with prototyping, I tried to find out as quickly as possible and at the same time with as little risk as possible. Parallel to the foundation of the company, I enrolled in the consecutive Business Informatics Master at the TU Munich. In the end, I even completed it with very good results, including an interim stay for my master's thesis at the renowned Stanford University in Silicon Valley. However, we liquidated the company after almost two years.
The end of the story? Although the company didn't work out, it was clear that nothing suits me better than entrepreneurship. Setbacks are the rule rather than the exception - I had to learn. Dealing with them is a personal challenge that makes your own life journey so varied and exciting.
After completing my master's degree, I therefore fully committed myself to self-employment and founded INNOSPOT GmbH, a company that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics to make the global start-up landscape transparent and accessible for companies. We scale innovation worldwide by bringing companies together with the best start-ups to jointly drive innovation and create positive value for our world. I have been doing this since 2017 as founder and CEO together with a team of 12 employees.

My studies in Deggendorf were an incredibly defining time for me, during which I learned a lot about myself. Originally, it was a great dream - and many years before that a very distant dream - for me to be able to study in Deggendorf. During my time at BOS, I often strolled along the dam of the university and imagined how I would study here one day. The dream came true and opened doors for me that I hadn't even dared to dream of as a teenager.
During my studies I tried to absorb everything possible. I remember the educational and fantastic time in the student convent of the university, in the faculty council, in the board of directors of WI-Project e.V. and great evenings with fellow students in the Deggendorf nightlife. I especially remember the time during the flood of the century, when I founded the student aid organisation "Deggendorf tidies up" together with a fellow student. The students of the university made an extremely valuable contribution to the city and the people of Deggendorf.
I have very intense and positive memories of my semester abroad at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The time in liberal California changed my view on many things once again and, in addition to all the other activities during my studies, gave me the great confidence that I could make a difference in the world.
What advice would you give to today's students?
1: Do it! Far too many really intelligent people I have met along the way can imagine founding a company, but are still waiting for "the idea". My own experience with INNOSPOT: To realise your dreams as an entrepreneur you don't have to have "the idea". Much more important than the actual idea is the team with which you turn the idea into reality. That is why we have taken a completely new path in founding INNOSPOT: First the team, then the idea.
2: Reflect. Only when I have really done something and then reflect on it do I get a solid assessment of what I enjoy and whether I have (developed) a passion for it. Life is a large collection of experiments and just like in chemistry, many experiments go wrong, some succeed and some are groundbreaking. But I can only make these experiences if I try out as many things as possible - be it internships, student jobs, semesters abroad, starting my own business - and evaluate things honestly for me later. That is why I can only encourage everyone: Try out as much as possible during your studies. Use this unique playground to discover what really fulfills you without any risk for you. And always have fun doing so :)

Career Development
During my Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering at the THD, my focus was already on technical building equipment (TGA) and Building Information Modelling (BIM). I have been involved in building services engineering from the 4th semester to the present day. As I also wanted to consolidate the theory in practice, I have been working in an engineering office for technical building services ever since. I also chose my specialisations for the Master's degree course in Civil and Environmental Engineering accordingly. While I spent my free study days working on the planning of technical systems, I still had another focus: working on planning processes as efficiently as possible, with networking and with a high degree of digitalisation. This led me to my second specialisation, BIM.
After completing my Master's degree in the summer semester of 2021, I joined the same engineering firm as an internal BIM manager. This was followed by further training in the field of BIM in order to introduce the methodology within the office together with my BIM team, define standards and implement them in projects. In addition to my work as a BIM manager, I also work as a research assistant in the field of teaching and research with the aim of obtaining a doctorate and as a freelance honorary lecturer in my two specialisations. Since the summer semester 2024, I have also been able to return to DIT. This time not as a student, but as a lecturer in the field of TGA.

DIT and the Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering in particular, has a family atmosphere. You know your fellow students here, which has a corresponding effect on the team spirit during and after your studies. There were many wonderful moments, celebrations and memories that I look back on today. Friendships developed during the preparatory course and are still going strong today. Friends with whom we went through some ups and downs during certain modules. But we made it! When I'm in the city of Deggendorf, I sometimes deliberately park near the campus rather than in the city centre. Just to walk past the buildings, stroll around the campus and reminisce.
What advice would you give to today's students?
"Focus - Concentrate - Realise!"
This motto emerged from our final excursion and has stayed with me ever since.If you have your goals in mind, you can achieve anything!
There are many paths open to you in the field of civil and environmental engineering.By choosing the right subjects, you can focus and concentrate on various areas at the BIW faculty and realise them professionally later on.
Take advantage of the continuing education programmes at the university.The specialist symposia and trade fairs were particularly helpful to me.These are a good opportunity to network with experts from the field during your studies. As a student, you have nothing to lose. On the contrary: networking will be important for you later in your career. So it's all the better if you can pick up this skill during your studies.
At the end of the semester (or day), don't forget to enjoy your time at university, because it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience!
Florian Sörgel
2020 | Master Civil and Environmental Engineering
Career Development
Before I started studying at DIT (2015 - 2020), I completed my subject-specific and then general higher education entrance qualification at the FOS Hof. Originally, I wanted to study to become a teacher. However, as the recruitment and transfer opportunities were very unclear at the time, my focus shifted to a degree programme in environmental engineering. I quickly realised that I wanted to pursue a career in which I would "leave my mark" at the end of the day and where you could always see tangible progress. Media technology, electrical engineering or business studies were never an option for me.
So I wanted to build something, especially environmentally conscious construction in combination with energy supply had brought me to Deggendorf. So I started the bachelor's degree in "Resource and Environmental Management", but through various lectures I realised that I was more interested in pure civil engineering. That's why I completed various internships at construction companies (Josef Rädlinger Bauunternehmen, AS Bau Hof) and an engineering office (Planungsbüro Schnabel). Through these internships, I found my future and current employer, Rädlinger Straßen- und Tiefbau GmbH in Selbitz. During my bachelor's degree and subsequent master's degree in "Civil and Environmental Engineering", I further deepened my knowledge and expertise in asphalt and road construction through student trainee jobs and final theses (bachelor's and master's theses) in Selbitz. I also had the opportunity to spend my entire 3rd master's semester in the company and worked there on a 20-hour basis while writing my thesis, which I found particularly helpful due to the many contacts with the then motorway directorate, now Autobahn GmbH des Bundes, the state building authorities and the proximity to practice.
I am currently working as a site manager in asphalt construction and - even though I am currently deviating somewhat from the initial idea of "environmentally conscious construction" (after all, asphalt is partly made of bitumen/petroleum 😉) - I have really found my dream job and wouldn't want to miss it. After a few years of professional experience, I am now also able to train and instruct the first young professionals/students, where the career aspiration of being a teacher from school age can then be realised.

I could tell you so much about my time at university that there's probably not enough space left. I remember exactly how I and my fellow students arrived at THD as completely awkward and stressed first-year students. Luckily, that soon died down and we learnt exactly how studying works. You realised that you can achieve more as part of a team than if you try to struggle through the first few semesters on your own. The VDBau and higher semesters in particular help the newcomers with old lecture notes, exams, tutorials or simply in conversations and pass on your tips over a relaxed beer. All the THD events, the Christmas party (which was legendary in its own way every year), the mulled wine sale, every VDBau regulars' table at Otto's, the Kneipenhupfa or the May festival also gave rise to countless friendships and stories. The THD was not only a university where I studied from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., but also a place where people simply met up in the evenings or during free hours and enjoyed spending their free time.
I will never forget the annual spring festivals, the Danube Festival and the countless pub/club trips during my time at university. I also made some lifelong friends here, which have since helped me in the professional world.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Really enjoy your time at university, because no-one will be able to give you this time, but they won't be able to take it away either. Exchange ideas with fellow students, especially with the higher semesters, this will really make your studies easier - nobody can give you better information and questions can't be answered better than by people who asked them themselves some time ago. Also use the time to connect, e.g. the VDBau or other clubs at DIT will help you during your studies, but also afterwards!
And rest assured: you will always get help at the TH Deggendorf - Mrs Heindl (secretariat of the BIW/UIW faculty) always had an open ear. Without her, my time at university would definitely have been more difficult.

2025 | Bachelor Civil and Construction Engineering
Career Development
After graduating from the Aloys-Fischer-Schule in Deggendorf, I began my civil engineering studies at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology in October 2021. I completed this dual programme at the company BiSt Tiefbau GmbH & Co. KG in Böbrach to gain practical experience in addition to the theoretical content for my future job as a site manager in pipeline construction.
After graduating, I moved to Pfaffinger Bau SE in Passau in March 2025, but continued to work in the pipeline construction division. Deggendorf Institute of Technology, especially the Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, offers numerous opportunities for professional networking, for example through excursions and trade fairs. This makes it easy for graduates to establish contacts with companies at an early stage and find a suitable career start.
During my studies, I was able to take advantage of various further training programmes offered by the university, including the acquisition of a training certificate and the qualification as a safety and health coordinator - both valuable additional qualifications for starting a career.
I also had the opportunity to work as a tutor at the university and pass on my knowledge of technical mechanics. This experience not only strengthened my teaching skills, but also deepened my own understanding of the subject. The interaction with students was an instructive and enriching time.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
My time studying at the DIT was always characterised by a family atmosphere and numerous experiences. Thanks to the manageable number of students in the lectures, you quickly get to know each other, which makes it easy to make new friends. Contact with the professors is also more personal and pleasant, as you are not just one of many.
A special highlight of the degree programme is the annual final excursion in the 7th semester. For five days, students visit construction sites abroad together with some of the professors. In addition to gaining valuable professional insights, there is plenty of time to explore the cities they visit and have unforgettable experiences. Our semester was also particularly fortunate to be able to go on a second major excursion at the end of the 7th semester. This gave us the unique opportunity to visit the construction site of the Brenner Base Tunnel between Austria and Italy and even see the drilling machine in action.
The nightlife in Deggendorf and student events are not neglected either. The Deggendorf Civil Engineers‘ Association organises regular get-togethers, including the regulars’ table at Schober Otto or the May Festival, where you can get to know not only fellow students from higher semesters, but also some professors in a relaxed atmosphere.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Make friends with whom you can learn together! This may sound like a typical parents' advice, but it helps enormously. Fellow students who become real friends are a great support, especially on unmotivated days.
Also, you are never on your own at the Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Everyone here is helpful and friendly. Whether you have questions or criticism, your concerns are taken seriously and you can get involved at any time without feeling guilty.
And the most important thing: enjoy your time at university! My time at DIT flew by. The many activities during the semester keep things exciting - and before you know it, your studies are over. Make the most of every opportunity to gain experience and experience unforgettable moments!

Career Development
In the 2nd practical semester, I was employed by STRABAG International GmbH in Poland as a construction phase manager (March-July 1998 in Bytom near Katowice, construction of a shopping centre for the German Metro Group) and already during the practical semester, I received a job offer as a construction manager from the then STRABAG boss in Poland, under the condition that I would be able to present a completed civil engineering degree by October 1999 at the latest. This was my motivation and pressure at the same time to complete my studies at DIT in eight semesters, including my diploma thesis (among other things, this is one of the reasons why I was probably the very first civil engineering graduate).
My first job was as a construction manager at STRABAG for the Real construction project (Metro Group) in Lublin. Then I became the project manager of the Metro Shopping Centre in Krakow, a prestigious project with a contract value of €26 million. Very independent work was necessary here. Building up a team, cooperating with the customer (including the Metro management) and, last but not least, intercultural cooperation (German, Austrian, Polish) provided me with important management skills in the technical, but also in the commercial and personnel areas at an early stage. During the team management, e.g. of an ECE shopping centre project with a contract value of €50 million, the STRABAG Management Board in Vienna "took notice" of me and I became divisional manager for large and special projects throughout Poland.
In January 2004 he was appointed to the national board. As technical director, I was responsible for STRABAG's structural and civil engineering in Poland, the development of a sustainable and nationwide organisation from project business to area business, the establishment of branch offices, etc. From January 2013 I was responsible as technical division manager for all operative business areas in Poland (traffic route construction, structural and civil engineering, bridge construction, railway construction, etc.) with an annual output volume of approx. € 900 million and approx. 5,000 employees.
Since January 2019, I have been a member of the Executive Board of the Group holding company STRABAG SE, responsible for the North + West segment (Germany, Poland, Scandinavia, Benelux) with an annual output volume of approx. € 8.0 billion and approx. 25,000 employees. 75,000 employees of the STRABAG SE Group generate an output of approximately €16.3 billion, making STRABAG the fifth largest construction company in Europe and the fourteenth largest construction company in the world.

As the first year of the civil engineering course, we had to work hard on lots of things ourselves together with the professors - there was no "blueprint" for either the professors or the students. This certainly entailed a lot of extra work, but the big advantage was that we had to get very involved and take responsibility. As a result, many students have also built up a close relationship with each other and with the professors - there was a kind of pioneering atmosphere overall. During this time, I also founded the "Verein der Deggendorfer Bauingenieure e.V.- VD-Bau" with fellow students (with formal support from Prof. Scherer) and was the first founding chairman.
In the middle/end of the 1990s Deggendorf was a very popular meeting place for young people within a radius of 100 km, i.e. the range of pubs, parties etc. could easily fill a 7-day week - which sometimes posed great challenges with regard to the compulsory attendance of some courses - but the development of soft skills during the studies was also important. So this time was not wasted.
Especially at that time, we also met with professors after the lectures, e.g. at the Christmas market - as I said, we had to "work" a lot together.
What advice would you give to today's students?
... do not to rely solely and exclusively on pure expertise!
In the age of digitalisation and increasing anonymity, social skills are becoming even more important. A technically sound education was and remains a basic requirement, but: As our processes on construction sites and processes close to construction sites become more and more complicated, the ability to work in a team is essential. The personal communication skills of all those involved play a major role here. Unfortunately, in the age of digitalisation, these skills are withering away because electronic communication dominates. Personal contact and discourse is avoided because it is perhaps more "strenuous"?!
Despite progressive digitalisation, people are still at the centre of the building industry, i.e. we deal with people every day: colleagues, superiors, customers, subcontractors, etc. Commitment, assumption of responsibility, respect, innovativeness, empathy, etc. are necessary values to enable a company and our society to operate successfully in the long term. But these values must be lived by all people in an organisation.
By the way, values cannot be replaced by machines or artificial intelligence!
For this reason, I can only encourage students to become more involved and take on responsibility during their studies, such as in student associations. The famous "thinking outside the box" is more topical than ever before. Please find out more about the challenges that digital transformation poses for employees and managers. The carousel of change is spinning faster and faster.
But this allows you to look to the future with great optimism: Civil engineers with a sound education, a "decent" portion of the above-mentioned values and social competence are and will continue to be in above-average demand on the job market.
But first of all: Enjoy your studies - especially the socialising!
Good luck with it!
Yours,

Career Development
In the summer of 2005 I completed my studies in the field of electrical engineering and information technology with the focus on automation technology as the last graduating class as Dipl.-Ing.(FH) at the University of Applied Sciences in Deggendorf. Before starting my professional life, I travelled through New Zealand and Australia from October to February 2006, before I started working as a test field engineer for small and large engines at the Loher motor factory in Ruhstorf.
During my two years of work I was able to build up my specialist knowledge of motors with/without explosion protection (Ex d, Ex i, Ex e) and generators, which was very helpful when I joined Finergy AG, based in Voerde/NRW, as "Sales and Service Engineer" for wind power generators and converters. In September 2011 I changed to Siemens AG and was responsible as "Quality Manager in Project" for preventive and operative quality planning and assurance in transnational projects for generators for the entire product life cycle. Due to the job requirements at both, Flender AG and Siemens AG, I had to make many business trips in Europe and China to get to know the country and its people directly on site.
In May 2017 I changed to the engineering office IB Graf for electrotechnical building equipment in Pfarrkirchen, which I took over one year later as owner with the current company name IB Bauer+Graf. The field of activity covers a wide range of tasks in the most diverse sub-trade from industrial buildings to the planning of villas for high voltage/low voltage applications and lighting design, taking into account the installation depth and safety-relevant equipment required by the client.

I have fond memories of my studies: learning and living in Deggendorf corresponded to my ideas and was very structured during my eight semesters, based on the lecture plan. I had a certain classmateship with my fellow students, and the professors were always interested in communicating knowledge in a comprehensible way and responding directly to questions during the lecture. The lecture style and the experiments in the laboratories also reminded me to a large extent of my school days and the documents provided for the lecture were very well prepared.
To this day I still meet former fellow students in my professional environment.
What advice would you give to today's students?
My time at Siemens and my planning office has always shown me and continues to show me new development opportunities to advance professionally and personally. I always accepted these opportunities and thus followed a certain road map that life and the professional world offered me. During my studies, the professors also taught me that constant learning in a professional environment, including language skills in English, awaits graduates and is indispensable. I can underline this statement as fully correct. The studies in Deggendorf enabled me to pursue my career so far and were a very good decision on my path in life.

The “Fachhochschule (FH) Deggendorf”, now Deggendorf Insitute of Technology (DIT), was very new when I was studying. Very close relationships to professors. We had a great form of interaction and learned many basic things which I still use today: especially in the first semesters.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Dare to ask questions! The professors (who I now belong to myself), also only cook with water. Focus on the ball, not on the man! You are the foundation of the future: Make the best of society.

After finishing my GCSEs, I decided to study electrical engineering at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology. The degree was inspiring because it was not only theory, but also had a focus on practical application through internships. Furthermore, I was a member of the then „High-Tech-Offensive Bayern“ team led by Prof. Dr. Ing. Grzemba. After successfully completing my electrical engineering studies at DIT in 2003, I continued to work as a laboratory/project engineer for industrial projects at the university until 2004. My first job in the free economy was from March 2004 until the end of September 2006 in the company Trimble Terrasat GmbH as GPS/GNSS/Galileo as software developer and project manager in development projects. Here I developed software and protocols for real time gps/gnss correction data distribution (e.g. protocol NTRIP or software GPSNet, NTRIPCaster). In October 2006 I changed to the automotive industry, to the company ASK Industries GmbH in Niederwinkling as developer and technical project manager for automotive audio amplifiers (including Porsche Burmester MOST audio amplifiers) from the development phase to SOP (and beyond) as a SW developer and also as a technical project manager. From 2011 to 2018, I worked at the automotive supplier HARMAN (Samsung subsidiary). My work was in the MOST/CAN/CAN-FD/Ethernet audio amplifier development department. My development work was very international, for example by travelling directly to the development site in Suzhou/Shanghai in China or the cooperation with Indian SW colleagues defined my everyday working life, among other things. At the same time, my exciting tasks included visits to conferences and the preparation of publications in specialist magazines. Customer projects at MBW (Booster, RAM), Volkswagen and Mercedes were my main focus. Since July 2018, I have been working as an engineer at BMW AG. The current highlight here was the application for a patent for the method of assessing welds using an artificial neural network.

If someone were to ask me today whether I would study again? I would definitely say YES, but at the same add, “but only at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology”. Since I am one of the first graduates from the Deggendorf Institute of Technology, we didn’t have as many offers as there are today, but the DNA of the university hasn’t changed. We still have top professors at the university and a range of courses that is unique in the region. I was proud of that back then and even more so today.
What advice would you give to today’s students?
I graduated at the age of 23, speak a variety of foreign languages (including Chinese) and have been working at BMW AG for three years. I won a prize at the internal international innovation week Think.Make.Start, where I developed a patent in just one week. I definitely owe the basis for this innovative ability to my education at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology. Therefore, my advice to my future academic colleagues of tomorrow is that they should value their time on campus, because it is really something "special" to be able to study at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology.

Career Development
I started out in the classic way with vocational training at the Mainkofen district hospital. Only afterwards I decided to complete my Abitur. This laid the foundation for my diploma studies at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology. I got my first job as a project manager in the area of plant construction and from September 2008 I was able to take over the responsibility as technical operations manager at the Mainkofen district hospital. Parallel to this job, I started my MBA studies in General Management at DIT's Centre for Further Education in 2010 to acquire additional skills. Three years after graduating with an MBA, I was appointed deputy hospital director in the management at the Mainkofen district hospital and moved to the Landshut district hospital as hospital director in October 2021. I am now responsible for an annual budget of around € 34 million at the Landshut, Deggendorf, Passau, Waldkirchen and Ziesel sites with around 600 employees.

Basically, I have very fond memories of that time, which I found absolutely extraordinary. The two MBA years were characterised by an intensive human and professional exchange that enriched me enormously. And above all, there was the individual, but at the same time collective goal of obtaining the MBA degree.
What was special for me, in contrast to the undergraduate diploma programme, was the very heterogeneous group of participants. People from different sectors, with different management experience, in different age groups and with different years of professional experience came together. This, coupled with lecturers with practical experience, very often led to lively and enriching discussions, which were often continued - usually on Friday evenings after the lecture - in a very relaxed round in the beer garden.
I also remember with pleasure the familiar feeling among the participants. The very demanding time, combined with personal sacrifices and not infrequently professional pressure, formed a very close group of participants. Nevertheless, our community was characterised by mutual respect, cohesion and understanding. This "family" relationship continues even ten years after graduation. I like to follow the professional or family development of former participants. During an exchange, you still very quickly find yourself in a familiar, honest atmosphere of conversation.
One of the highlights was, of course, the stay abroad at the University of Kent at Canterbury in England. The days ended punctually at five o'clock in the pub and often turned into fireside chats. I even let Prof. Dr. Nagengast convince me of the beneficial effects of a morning jog. I still have the jogging shoes I bought in England today and they look like new 😉.
What advice would you give to today's students?
The MBA programme was definitely an enrichment for my life and an experience I wouldn't want to miss. Initially, I "only" had the goal of a Master's degree in management in mind. However, I soon realised that the programme was so much more. This degree programme enables you to leave behind the sometimes very technical viewpoint in order to recognise and understand larger contexts.
Without knowing at the time how my career would develop, I can say today that without the MBA programme I would certainly not be a hospital director.
To the current students in the MBA programme I would like to give the following tip: "Start your coursework early and stick to it, because the last night is definitely always shorter than expected and formatting always takes longer than expected".

Career Development
First I studied Electrical Engineering in Regensburg from 1987-1992 and gained my first professional experience in a small engineering office in the field of software development for industrial controls. That's when I took my first steps towards marketing and sales.
After about five years I was interested in a different industry: I started in a company for embedded PC technologies. During this time, I held various international and global functions, including building up an international business, commercial management of a product centre, management of marketing and sales, and global leadership of product management. My position has changed constantly (every three years) within the rapidly growing organisation. I started as the 32nd employee in a "start-up" and after 18 years I found myself in a corporate structure with about 2500 employees.
During my time as Head of Product Centre I completed the MBA General Management at DIT parallel to my job. The increasingly commercial orientation of my position at that time called for a more in-depth, intensive training in order to meet the increased leadership and management responsibilities for companies and employees better.
After a total of 18 years in this field, I wanted to do a complete reorientation and started at b-plus GmbH in Deggendorf. Initially I took over the management of the marketing and communication department for the b-plus group and at the same time built up the subsidiary b-plus automotive as managing director. Under my leadership, the company has been expanded since its foundation in June 2015 to meanwhile more than 70 employees. With the focus on basic software for driver assistance systems, b-plus automotive also works on new and innovative product and solution approaches in the field of Connected Car and Artificial Intelligence.
An end to my career is not in sight yet, I am looking forward to everything that has yet to come!

Despite all the challenges of studying parallel to your job: The balancing act between work, private life and lectures is feasible. The path is the goal. The learning phase was ideally linked to the working environment that the subject areas to be prepared always had a real and immediately applicable practical relevance within the everyday working life.  Luckily, at that time I had exactly the job where I could try out and implement everything immediately.
I particularly enjoyed the exchange with like-minded people during my "second student period": The discussions with my fellow students were extremely enriching. An invaluable side-effect of an MBA program while working: You learn a lot from other industries and from the everyday life of other professionals or other managers.
All in all, I would like to say that a "job with a degree" has a much higher learning value for me. You can classify the knowledge you acquire in a completely different way and apply it to your own work, because you are in the middle of your professional life and have already experienced a lot here.
Another advantage of the MBA program in Deggendorf: If you can reflect on yourself well, the MBA - after a certain amount of practical experience - also shows you where you still have a real need for further training. Because learning goes on and on, also and especially as a manager!
What advice would you give to today's students?
My advice: You don't have or want to learn everything at once - it's about lifelong learning. It is definitely a good idea to leave a few years for practical experience between your studies and postgraduate studies. After all, only in the course of one's working life can one assess what else one might need. You may discover a new focus of interest for yourself and then train specifically through a second course of study.
High Performance / Quantum Computing
Yaknan Gambo
2023 | Master High Performance Computing / Quantum Computing
Career Development
Looking back on how my journey into High-Performance Computing and Quantum Computing (PPCQC) research and industry began, I am just amazed how a little spark can start a great fire.
I had nursed a Passion for High-performance Computing, AI, and the Internet of things as a graduate. This led to my pursuit of a masters` degree in Computer Science from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, with a focus on HPC. Inspired by a parallel programming course in OpenMP and MPI, I performed a comparative study of two parallel programming platforms, OpenCL and Intel Cilk Plus.
While doing this, I never anticipated how events would lead me to a career in the HPCQC space. An encounter in 2021 with an innovative program in HPCQC at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology marked a pivotal moment in my career. I applied out of curiosity and an interest in HPC, and perhaps to learn something about Quantum Computing along the way. I became one of twelve successful students admitted into the program, which was the first of its kind in the EMEA region. At the start of the program, COVID restrictions were still in place and most of our lectures were delivered online. The lectures were intense and practical-oriented, featuring experts from data centers and HPC software and hardware industry. Imagine my surprise when the CEO of the Khronos group, makers of OpenMP, gave us a lecture on parallel architectures. I was blown away by the depth of expertise displayed. I never knew that I would have the opportunity to be lectured by the developers themselves.
Despite initial frustrations due to visa delays, I was able to participate in later excursions to state-of-the-art data centers in Munich. The Quantum Computing component, initially a mystery to me, was gradually demystified by the numerous workshops, hands-on programming tasks, and competition on subject. The internship opportunity is also noteworthy. I interned with Intel and Leibniz Supercomputing Center (LRZ), an inspiring experience that facilitated my ability to find relevance in both research and industry. I must express my gratitude to the innovators of the HPCQC Masters´s program for crafting such an extraordinary program with such a wide array of diverse and impactful learning experiences.
So I am actually working as Quantum User Enablement Application Researcher at Leibniz Supercomputing Centre, pursuing a PhD in HPCQC integration at the TU München.

I cannot discuss the HPCQC program without mentioning the vibrant city of Deggendorf. The cost of living in Deggendorf is reasonable and its cosmopolitan environment is welcoming to foreigners, even allowing students to explore a variety of cuisines, from Indian and Greek to Chinese and Vietnamese, among others. As an African, I have been able to find familiar groceries, which was quite heartwarming.
During my time here, I have forged meaningful friendships that have enriched me. Weekends are often spent cycling or strolling along the extensive cycling and hiking routes, engaging in heartfelt conversations about life while appreciating the beauty of nature, especially along the Donau river and parts of the Bavarian Forest.
What advice would you give to today's students?
For future students considering a well-rounded and innovative learning experience, I recommend the HPCQC program at DIT. This program has not only shaped my academic understanding but has had a profound impact on my mental, relational, and practical skills. The combination of theoretical knowledge, hands-on experiences, and industry exposure has been instrumental in my career development.
In Conclusion, the DIT HPCQC program played a significant role in shaping my trajectory, and as I continue to contribute to the field through my role as a Quantum researcher, I encourage future students to embark on their educational journey with curiosity, resilience, and eagerness to embrace the unexpected.

I obtained my general higher education entrance qualification at Zwiesel High School in 2019 and then started my dual study programme in industrial engineering at Deggendorf Institute of Technology in the 2019/2020 winter semester.
After a "normal" first semester, I was surprised by the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020, as was the rest of the world, and Deggendorf Institute of Technology switched to online teaching.
The second and third semesters took place entirely online, while the following semesters offered a mixture of online and face-to-face teaching. Even though the personal aspect of my studies suffered due to the pandemic-related restrictions, online teaching was more of an advantage than a disadvantage for me, as I was able to focus intensively on the course content due to the lack of distractions. At this point, I would like to say a big thank you to all the professors at the NUW faculty, who also taught the course content very well online!
In the fourth semester, I was able to take on the Technical Mechanics 2 tutorial. This was followed by the Physics 2 tutorial in the fifth and seventh semesters. Thanks to Mr Sosnowsky and Mr Marek for this opportunity!
During my studies, I was supported by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation. In addition to financial support, the Friedrich Naumann Foundation enabled me to attend many seminars throughout Germany, where I was able to build up an extensive network of academics.
I completed my dual study programme with in-depth practical experience at Zollner Elektronik AG, one of the top 15 EMS service providers worldwide. This also made my lecture-free time very instructive and exciting. During the practical phases at the various company locations in the Upper Palatinate, I was able to get a taste of many areas and I realised what opportunities are available to me as an industrial engineer. After completing my practical semester in the Electronics 2 division in the New Business Development department, I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on the topic of virtual reality in the seventh semester. I investigated the potential of this pioneering technology in a business environment and was able to test a wide range of VR hardware and software.
At the end of the winter semester 2022/2023, I completed my studies at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology and have been working as a project manager in Global Engineering at Zollner Elektronik AG ever since.

I have very fond memories of my time in Deggendorf - especially as two of my friends had a roof terrace where the odd student party was thrown (my room in the student hall of residence couldn't keep up :-)).
At the TH Deggendorf, I particularly liked the small group size of the degree programme. This meant that you had close contact with the professors, which enabled intensive supervision.
I particularly enjoyed the graduation ceremony at the end of my degree programme, where a celebration was held on the grounds of Deggendorf Institute of Technology with all the graduates from the previous two semesters.
What advice would you like to give today's Bachelor of Industrial Engineering students?
Don't neglect the practical part of your studies! As an industrial engineer, many doors are open to you - but it is only through practical experience that you find the right one for you. For me, working as a project manager was very valuable, as it gave me a comprehensive insight into various areas of activity in an industrial company and taught me a lot about my own career aspirations.

It wasn't an easy start: when I moved house, my brother's car broke down - luckily in Deggendorf, within reach of my new home, and not on the motorway beforehand. But things only got better after that! Compared to the TU Munich, I clearly prefer the DIT, at least in terms of student life. A clearly structured degree programme, the informal interaction with professors, course assistants and administration, well-organised student clubs - I liked it all very much. When I think back, I have fond memories of the canteen party in the first semester, but also the IM-specific international team building in Finsterau, the annual mulled wine sale, ... Through all the events and the local proximity, I not only learnt a lot at DIT, but also made friends for life with whom I still meet up regularly today - no matter where they are scattered around the world. I also liked the openness of our degree programme, the fact that we maintained close contact over the semesters and friendships developed. One of the most formative experiences for me was definitely the exchange semester in Spain and the internship abroad in London, where I was suddenly completely on my own - I can only recommend this to anyone, no matter where they go. For my Master's degree, I was in Tallinn, Estonia - an unusual destination with an equally great experience.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Just do it.While the word commitment sounds like a lot of effort, the benefits for you are immense.Whether you get involved in student organisations such as IMTC, Fast Forest or ESN, promote student representation or get politically involved, you will learn an incredible amount.You can try your hand at real-life collaboration, team management, event organisation, etc.Do you have a cool idea and want to set something up yourself?Try it out - just do it!There's never been a better time than during your studies, and DIT will even support you.Would you like to get a taste of consulting?Then try out consult-it! and do exciting internships! No matter what you do, it's just important that you do something and try it out. Make the most of the time and the many opportunities you have at DIT.

I studied International Management at DIT between 2009 and 2013 and already did my first internships in the start-up and venture capital sector, as it was already clear to me back then that I wanted to become an entrepreneur. After graduating, however, I couldn’t resist my childhood dream and first worked as a trainee and then as a marketing and sales coordinator at Ferrari Central Europe before moving to the headquarters in Maranello, Italy, as a business development manager.
After three years at Ferrari, I took the leap into entrepreneurship and founded LOEWI together with Philipp Merk and Calvin Devereux to make personalised health available to everyone. We helped thousands of customers improve their health and well-being with LOEWI, had one of the largest venture capital funds in Europe on board as an investor and successfully sold the company after exactly three years.
At the same time, I try to share my experiences with students, including teaching the course “Entrepreneurship & Innovation” as a lecturer at DIT.

During the Abitur I noticed that I enjoy organising things, but after the Abitur I decided to go to Australia for some time to learn English and enjoy my freedom. After my return, the thought of event management had solidified, I saw my strengths in this business area. Accordingly, I was looking for a course of studies that was a bit more diversified and with which I could later go into different areas if I should notice that the event industry is not really my thing after all. I decided to do an internship in the event industry before I started my studies to get first impressions of what it is like to work in this field and I really liked it right away. By chance I came across the International Management course in Deggendorf and simply submitted my application, with success.
If I had to describe my career after graduation in one word, it would be the word "bumpy".
After my studies I moved to London and thought with a bachelor degree, 3 languages and two completed internships it would be no problem to find a job or at least another internship. However, this turned out to be more difficult than expected. At some point I started working as a waiter because I had cabin fever and money was running out. During a break while waiting tables I got into a conversation with the owner of the restaurant chain, who offered me a job as an event manager starting the next day. Event management for three restaurants was not what I wanted to do but it was a start and I thought: "better than nothing". After about a year I started sending out applications for other jobs from time to time, which was very frustrating. The job market in London is very crowded and everybody seems to have a lot of qualifications. It got to the point where I was even happy about rejection, because that was better than no feedback. After two and a half years in the restaurant business I found a new job and I was overjoyed... until I started there. After only one week I realised that this job would not fulfill me at all. As chance would have it, I got into conversation with an event agency through an acquaintance at the same time, which actually didn't have any vacancies. After five interviews they offered me a job, which was a great relief, because I wouldn't have been able to continue with the other "new" job for much longer. The negative point about the job in the event agency was that I had to start at the bottom again, i.e. from event manager to event assistant. But I really wanted to work in an event agency, so it was worth it.
It took a while until I had gained the necessary trust of my bosses. After a year I was frustrated to still be in the assistant position, but I promised myself I would grit my teeth and keep on doing it. Today I can say that it was worth it. After almost two years, everything changed and my career took off. I got two promotions within half a year and now I am where I wanted to be. It all came a bit later than planned, but sometimes you have to take a detour to get what you want. It is important not to give up, even if it is sometimes difficult.

The thought of moving to Deggendorf (a place I had never heard of before) did not appeal to me at all at the beginning. I had received a rejection for my desired course of studies at another university and was frustrated. However, my mood changed right in the first week of my studies and I can now say that it was the best decision of my life to study in Deggendorf. I had an amazing time and made friends for life. The IM course was just the right thing for me and my plans to work in the event business. To cut a long story short: you learn a little bit from everything (even if some professors might not want to hear that :-), which helps me a lot in my current job. The mixture of hard and soft skills in this course of studies is perfect and I have learned and experienced an incredible amount. The IM program enabled me to do an internship in Berlin in an event agency and to spend two semesters abroad in Mexico. Two things that have helped me a lot, both professionally and personally. The contact between professors and students is very relaxed, which made it much easier to attend lectures :-)
What advice would you give to today's students?
What do I want to give the students today without sounding like a mother? - Enjoy your study time, take as much as possible with you without missing the fun times of studying. If you have the opportunity to do an internship and/or a
semester abroad
- go for it. Nothing prepares you better for working life than this. And very important: don't bury your head in the sand after the first semester, everything is not as bad as it sometimes seems at the beginning. The same applies when you start working. Sometimes you have to take detours to get where you want to go.

After graduating from high school I did an internship as an event manager and then studied international management at DIT. Afterwards I had the chance to gain insights into supply chain management at Siemens Wind Power (now Siemens Gamesa). However, I soon realised that I wanted to do a master's degree and decided to study International Management at Strathcylde Business School in Glasgow. I was then faced with the decision of either going into industry or following the call of the supervisor of my Master's thesis and doing my PhD. I decided to do a PhD and did so for 3 ½ years at the University of Coventry, focusing on stakeholder management in the automotive industry and the relationships between business, politics and civil society organisations. Afterwards I started as a lecturer at Coventry Business School with the aim of entering the business world in the medium term.

I remember my time in Deggendorf very well. I especially remember the many exciting encounters with students from all over the world and the opportunity to learn about different cultures. I am still in touch with many people from back then and I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to study in South America and to do an internship in Asia. I believe that these stays abroad had a significant influence on my personal development and professional orientation.
What advice would you give to today's students?
To be curious and, despite all the complexity and uncertainties, to acquire a positive attitude that enables one to meet inspiring people and to be perceived as exciting at the same time
To think big and not to let your own fear or the limits of your comfort zone slow you down
Regularly acknowledge what has already been achieved and document goals and development steps
Make connections with interesting people early on and don't be afraid to ask (unknown) people for advice. Normally curiosity is appreciated.

It took a very long time before I knew what I wanted or what I was good at. So I tried to get experience in as many things as possible at a very early stage in order to work my way towards my dream job. First I did an apprenticeship, then my desire to study in English and in as small a programme as possible brought me to Deggendorf. After my studies and the stays abroad, I worked, did an MBA in Brussels and then ended up at Google. Marketing and media was the area that really inspired me in terms of content and people.
From Google I moved to Dentsu Aegis Network, a global agency network. There I found the greatest possible creative freedom for myself, first as agency managing director in Austria and since 2015 as Group CEO Switzerland in Zurich. We have now grown to over 700 employees in Switzerland and cover not only media and marketing but also IT consulting and business transformation.

I often and gladly remember the time in Deggendorf, especially because of the people it was really something special. The university was very familiar, International Management was a small, colourful programme with great subjects and Deggendorf itself was friendly, affordable and open to us students. From my studies, I took lifelong friendships with me that mean a lot to me.
I like to think back to the lectures and projects, the focus on soft skills was ahead of its time and prepared us well for many key moments in our careers. All in all, I simply had a lot of funny and remarkable scenes in my head that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
What advice would you give to today's students?
You should enjoy the time and not put yourself under pressure by setting too specific goals. If you set yourself a job, an employer or even a certain salary too early, you will miss many exciting opportunities and may not spontaneously accept a challenge. There are so many opportunities to try yourself out during your studies that you should make use of them. Founding a company, failing with it or making it successful is secondary. Impressions and experiences from success and failure are always helpful and are also highly appreciated by employers.

After graduating from High School in South America, Ecuador, I went to live in the US for 6 months. This was a great experience. It opened my views regarding the world. Later, I started studying in the university in Ecuador “Business administration” for a year, after that, I worked for the car manufacture AUDI which connected me with Germany, during this time in my life, it became clear to me that I wanted to study abroad, I was hungry for more. I started studying in Deggendorf in 2005 which was an amazing experience, coming from a big city in South America, Deggendorf was so familiar, personal and exciting. I had the opportunity to make my semester abroad in Italy and later my internship in the UK which were very valuable for my personal growth. After my studies in Deggendorf I have been working for a German company called “Lindner AG” for 4 years as the Sales manager for the Latin American Markets, I was able to travel all over Latin America and I had the pleasure of getting to know extremely interesting people; this was an eye opener to see what was actually possible. In 2010, I started my own company Ecualeman GmbH with one of my best friends, this was the best decision in my life, now we are one of the main suppliers of goods to clients in Europe, South America and Asia. In 2014, I opened a second company “Café Sud America (CSA) GmbH”, bringing premium coffee with our own brand from South America to Europe. Due to all my past experiences, I soon realized that anything is possible if you are willing to take the risks, be disciplined and patient.

During my studies I had a different view of the world. I saw many invisible rules that don’t really exist in the real world, I had the opportunity to get to know myself, to get to know people from different backgrounds which I believe is extremely important for your personal growth. Leaving the place and people you grow up with is a very therapeutical thing, I wish everybody could have this experience.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Focus in people the most, look for people with values, with different backgrounds. Connections are more powerful than CV’s, you need to build your own army with great people around you to be able to go further in life. Learn to be a team player, stay in contact with all your international fellow students, you never know, you might start a company with them in the near future.
Pay attention to 3 things moving into the future; your financial independence, your mental/physical health and your relationships, this is more important than anything you believe is important during your studies. It’s impossible to be happy all the time, accept it, but these 3 points will bring you peace. A peaceful environment is the key to a fulfilling and rewarding life.

During studies as a working student / intern at Streicher and VTA, internship at Daimler (Sindelfingen) in the development department, semester abroad in Sweden, fast and uncomplicated, which definitely promotes the career for MBler! "Thinking outside the box".
Final thesis at Airbus in Hamburg. Prof. Bongmba (as a former employee) endorsed the "feeling" of being a part in the company, not only as an employee but also with excellent support from DIT.
Big dream to work in aviation was fulfilled. First job with the Airbus Group. (in the field of Product Lifecycle Management = internal consulting of the complete Airbus Group).
Decision: technical competence or more into the direction of management ... then an offer from EY. That was at the end of 2014.
Worked up from consultant to manager within four years.
Focus on PLM in a closed loop approach = all customers from different industries, consulting from the idea to service/recycling (which data must be provided so that it can be disposed of properly). A great advantage is that the technical background is there to present the entire process flow and keep an overview.

After the Abitur I studied twice, both times at DIT. First I studied mechanical engineering (at that time I still had a degree in engineering) and then I did an MBA while still working. That was easy to arrange, because it was block seminars and you didn't have to be on site every weekend.
I did my first (at that time there were still two) internship semester at Linde in the USA, the second one at BMW in Munich. I then wrote my diploma thesis there and returned to Munich for another three years after a three-year detour to MAN Truck & Bus. After that I was able to take over my parents' business in Bogen, Schnupp Hydraulik. We come from the hydraulics sector, but we are now also allowed to build entire production lines and industrial presses for our customers. Today, 160 employees generate annual sales of around € 27 million.

I have fond memories of my time in Deggendorf. My father and my brother both studied in Munich. The state capital may be more exciting at first glance, but it is also much more anonymous. In Deggendorf there was something to do almost every day or evening in my time, you knew most of the people there and could always meet many friends without having to make a big date. I still have many friends from my time in Deggendorf.
What advice would you give to today's students?
From my own experience of my time as an employee: if possible, try out as many jobs as possible during your studies, which is not so easy later on, and also make contact with possible employers. That worked out very well for me. So I was recommended from the internship semester to the diploma thesis and the subsequent employment.
Besides, a semester abroad is a very good idea. Most companies are now international and it is more a must than a bonus to speak English fluently and have proven that you can get by on your own abroad. I would always prefer to do a practical semester abroad rather than going to university. It's more strenuous, but you get much better in the language and gain deep insights into the working world of the country than in the study environment with lots of other internationals who perhaps don't speak better English than you do.

After a successful apprenticeship as a mechanical engineering mechanic at Streicher Maschinenbau in Deggendorf, a 10 month military service in the fighter squadron 74 "Mölders" in Neuburg on the Danube followed. At the Aloys-Fischer-School in Deggendorf I acquired the technical college entrance qualification in 2001. In the winter semester 2001 I started my studies at DIT in the department of mechanical engineering, which I finished in spring 2005. During my studies, I accompanied a work placement as a student trainee at the GFH-GmbH under Prof. Dr. Helml, which was mainly concerned with the development of test machines for diesel injection nozzles. Through these contacts and the help of Prof. Dr. Helml, I was able to complete an internship semester in the USA at Delphi Automotive in 2004.
After my studies, my main focus was production engineering, but I desperately had to change this. The Maschinenelemente II (Seminar) third attempt in the 8th semester left its mark on me. So I ended up as a sales engineer at Bartec GmbH in Gotteszell, which was then under the direction of Prof. Dr. Fröhlich. After a nice 2 years and the realisation that electronics is not my world, I changed to Kurt Willig GmbH & Co. KG in Straubing. Tank trucks made of aluminium, to touch, grind and weld. That was more my world.
In 2009 I took over the sales management at Willig Group and in 2016 I was additionally appointed as an authorised signatory.
In summer 2010 I met a crazy Australian who told me that he can make tanks from carbon fibre. He didn't have to convince my colleagues and me for long, so we started thinking about how to get the job done. In 2014, the companies decided to join forces. In 2016 a JV of the two companies was founded, the Omni Willig Carbon GmbH, whose management I took over as an additional task.

It is almost impossible to explain this in a nutshell, it would fill volumes. The time of my studies was certainly one, if not the best time I had.
Of course there were challenges one has to take. Descriptive geometry, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, (are these all Nietzsche subjects?), etc. Business studies can also become a problem if you don't go to the lecture. But all in all, the study was always exciting and above all fair. There were 11 of us in the main focus and we had a good team spirit. These contacts are partly still going on. I also see this as the strength of the DIT. The familiar atmosphere, as well as the personal connection to the professors. That is what makes the DIT's good education, the cooperation.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Use the time now to ask questions. Now tasks can still be corrected. A lower grade does not necessarily spoil the access to the better job. Take the opportunity to ask what was wrong. In professional life only one person corrects, the customer! But from then on it costs money. You are the one who has to take responsibility for it! Employers of today, at least not the ones I know, do not choose their employees according to the grade sheet. You have to fit into the team. Only those who feelcomfortable in a position can perform well!
The most important thing of all is: stay as you are and don't pretend. A B.Eng. on your business card does not make an engineer!

Primary school in the Netherlands, then grammar school - but then dropped out because of moving to Austria, one year of secondary school in Austria, then secondary school in Simbach/Inn, technical secondary school in Pfarrkirchen and FH Deggendorf.
In the last year of my ME studies, I worked as a student trainee at Austria Metall AG (AMAG), and from autumn 2002 I had a permanent position and wrote my diploma thesis within the framework of an AMAG project. He then joined the company as assistant to the managing director of AMAG Casting GmbH. Two years later I was promoted to production manager and, due to his increasing responsibility for the profit and loss account, in 2005/2006 he received an MBA from the University of Louisville while working. At the end of 2006, I became plant manager at AMAG Extrusion GmbH, from which Hammerer Aluminium Industries GmbH emerged in 2007 within the framework of a company spin-off.
Here I became the managing director for the recycling and foundry in 2008 and spent almost 2 years in Romania to build and start up a new plant. 2010 when I returned to Austria I was appointed CEO of the HAI Group. At that time the company had 2 locations and 260 million turnover with 480 employees. Together with my team, we have succeeded in using the difficult years after the economic crisis for a strategic reorientation and thus we were able to almost double our turnover to 480 million by 2017 and even more than double the number of jobs to 1150! HAI currently supplies high-quality aluminium components from 6 locations in Austria, Romania and Germany for the automotive industry as well as all other transport segments and also for numerous applications in construction and industry..

After the technical secondary school I absolutely wanted to study technical studies and at that time mechanical engineering was just being built up in Deggendorf. Since many of my school colleagues also oriented themselves towards Deggendorf, the decision was made quickly and I have never regretted it. It was almost family back then. Getting in touch with the professors was possible at any time and very informal...including the odd beer in the "wheelhouse". Professionally, (most...;-) professors were in a good mood and also tried to bring the technical topics across accordingly...(I will never forget the picture of Professor Nitsche, how he used his "little belly" in combination with all the utensils in the room to give us an understanding of descriptive geometry...;-).
I still remember the basic study period as "dry" and very theoretical and so some lectures after one or the other student party were a bit tedious...but after the division into the main subjects it was very interesting and I got a lot of knowledge which is still very useful for me today.
In the main focus we had quasi individual lessons...we were exactly 4 students at the beginning of today's DIT who had chosen the main focus production engineering! I am still in contact with the professor responsible, Joachim Helml, and he even visited me in Romania almost two years ago. I hope that DIT has maintained this proximity to the students...even though it will certainly not be possible to do so intensively with this growth...
What advice would you give to today's students?
Use the time while you're studying - not only to acquire knowledge - but also to form friendships and networks - I am still in contact with a few fellow students today and one of them is working as a managing director in our Romanian plant.
Make sure you do a semester abroad! The experiences you make there are an invaluable gain! The challenge of having to "survive" in a completely new environment in a foreign language shapes and encourages you to accept and master challenges later on!
Create a good study-/life balance. The time as a student is unique and in later life you will never again be able to spend so much time for yourself and your interests!

Up to my current position as project manager it was not the shortest way.
After graduating from secondary school (technical field) I first learned the profession as an administrative assistant. Since I did not see myself in this field for the rest of my life, I decided to catch up on my general school certificate at the vocational high school in Deggendorf. Through my brother Markus I got some insights into the dual study of electrical engineering and decided to study mechatronics at Strama-MPS Maschinenbau GmbH & Co. KG, combined with a vocational training as a mechatronics engineer.
Strama-MPS develops special machines for the production, assembly and testing of complex technical components and products. Altogether, more than 1,300 specialists work at Strama-MPS worldwide - about 750 of them at the Straubing location.
My current position in the company requires me to be able to react quickly to acutely arising issues. Therefore I need a good overview of the whole project and am responsible for cost planning, customer meetings and site planning. In the end, a complete production line with various assemblies is created. The line is completed down to the last detail and put through its paces so that it can be reassembled and put into operation at the customer's site.

I would always decide again for a dual study at the TH Deggendorf, because you can deepen the acquired knowledge besides the theoretical training at the same time in practice. Apart from the good leisure activities in Deggendorf, I also like to think back to DIT's Christmas party. With good food and atmospheric music one could enjoy a nice evening with friends. I would also like to emphasize the good cooperation among the students. This was also encouraged and challenged by the professors themselves through various topics that were worked on in teamwork. This includes the two compulsory projects during the studies - and the related excursions to the Czech Republic.
What advice would you give to today's students?
I would advise students to stick together. This will pay off well at the latest when working out the learning material before the exams. First of all by saving a certain amount of time and secondly by having one or more partners who may also have an answer to one or the other question. For the remaining open topics I can only say from my experience that the professors of DIT have an open ear and are happy to help.

Why did you choose this degree programme?
After my bachelor studies in Mechatronics, I wanted to pursue further studies to deepen my knowledge and specialize in the field of mechatronic systems that integrate AI solutions. This programme at the DIT was the perfect choice since it provides many newly advanced technologies in mechatronic systems.
Remember your time at the DIT: how was it studying at Cham?
This programme has many diverse paths and a wide variety of topics as well as the case studies that are part of some courses, which let me practically apply what I learned in theory.
Why should an international student study at DIT?
At DIT, you will get to know many students with different backgrounds and cultures. You will also be given the opportunity to learn a new language provided each semester by the language center at DIT.

Describe your professional career after your Graduation:
I come from India; I currently live and work in Germany. Basically, I am passionate about smart products. Collecting data from different sensors and playing with AI algorithms is my hobby. To develop such futuristic products, one should definitely master technologies from different domains. My degree programme “Mechatronic and Cyber-Physical Systems” was a perfect choice for me, as it is focused on teaching a stack of trending technologies.
Remember your time at the DIT: how was it studying at Cham?
I enjoyed learning from industrial expert professors, gaining multidisciplinary skills and knowledge from this degree programme. It gave me a strong base to solve complex engineering problems. This foundation helped me, for instance, to develop an "Intelligent Smart Mover" during my Master’s programme.
Why should an international student study at DIT?
Studying at DIT not only gives you an opportunity to meet amazing people, but there is a striking alumni network. The positive atmosphere and friendly faculty at DIT allow its students to engage in activities beyond academics. In short, DIT challenges its students not only to pursue their academic goals but also their personal interests.

Beruflicher Werdegang
Ich arbeite derzeit in der Elektronik- und Mechatronik-Herstellungsindustrie als Testingenieur, nachdem ich aus der Öl- und Gasindustrie als Bauingenieur gewechselt habe.
Mein Ziel ist es, ein Profi im Bereich Embedded System (Soft- und Hardware) zu werden. Ich glaube, dass ich mit dem Studium Mechatronics and Cyber-Physical Systems an der TH Deggendorf das Fundament für diesen Bereich gelegt habe.
Schwelgen erlaubt: Erinnern Sie sich an Ihre Studentenzeit
Die Erinnerung an die erste Weihnachtsfeier auf dem Campus wird mir immer im Gedächtnis bleiben. Sie war so freundlich und einladend, wenn man bedenkt, dass ich gerade erst in Deutschland angekommen war. Ich war extrem aufgeregt mit Menschen aus verschiedenen Kulturen zu interagieren und neue Freunde zu finden.
Ich denke auch, dass die Lernatmosphäre ziemlich einzigartig war, weil ich keine Spannungen zwischen den Studierenden/Professor:innen Beziehungen bemerkt habe. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass ich jedes Mal, wenn ich die Vorlesungen besucht habe, von einem Freund gelernt habe. Die Aufgeschlossenheit der Professor:innen machten die Kunst des Lernens noch erstrebenswerter.
Ich hatte meine erste spannende Hackathon Erfahrung im März 2019 (Moving Station Pilsen) mit meinen Kolleg:innen, die mir aktuelle Trends in den Mechatronik-bezogenen Technologien näher gebracht haben, und ich möchte mich bei der Hochschule für diese Möglichkeit bedanken, da ich auf dem Gebiet der Mechatronik neu war.
Was möchten Sie den aktuellen Studierenden mit auf den Weg geben?
Ich habe gelernt, dass man sich als Student:in sehr anstrengen muss, um Kompetenz in jedem Wissensgebiet zu erlangen. Die Professor:innen werden zwar immer Anleitung und Hilfe geben, aber man muss erkennen, dass wir die Haupttreibenden sind, um Lösungen für die Konzepte zu finden, die uns interessieren.
Fühlen Sie sich frei auf Ihre Kommiliton:innen zuzugehen und seien Sie bereit Ihr Wissen mit anderen zu teilen, die danach suchen.
Ich habe sehr von den Tutorien profitiert, die mein Kommilitone organisiert hat und zwar auf verschiedene Arten, die ein tieferes Verständnis, mehr Zeit für Fragen und Nachfragen ermöglicht haben. Daher empfehle ich nachdrücklich, dass Tutorien Lernhilfen sind und nicht als Ersatz für den Besuch von Vorlesungen angesehen werden sollten.
Abschließend rate ich Ihnen offen zu sein und alles so einfach wie mögich zu halten. Nehmen Sie Kritik an, denn das wird den Raum für Entwicklung öffnen und die Bereitschaft stärken, Dinge unabhängig vom erwarteten Ergebnis auszuprobieren.

After travelling to Asia, I continued to work there as an SEO consultant. Which I still love doing, but preferably for a slightly different target group.
That's why I started my own business, SEO4Good, in 2021. I now work with companies that sell sustainable products in their online shop and have too few orders. I help these e-commerce companies to become visible on the internet and get enough orders.

I have fond memories of the THD. Above all, I liked the fact that I was able to try out a lot of things there. Whether in the courses, the electives or in my part-time job in the STEM team. Thanks to the small course sizes and the strong support from fellow students, professors and university staff, I was able to settle in quickly and learn a lot of new things. The fact that I had previously completed my Bachelor's degree at another university - the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria - was not a problem. Although my degree there did not fulfil the required number of ECTS credits for the Master's degree, I was able to make up the missing credits easily with an internship and the required PLVs.

Use your studies to try out different things and stay curious.

I grew up in the district of Deggendorf - more precisely in Winzer and in Hengersberg - and came here from Niederalteich primary and secondary school, via Schöllnach secondary school and the FOS in Deggendorf to the Deggendorf Institute of Technology. Fortunately, I was one of the last students to start my studies in the diploma programme Media Technology and fortunately I also had the option to continue my studies seamlessly in Deggendorf as one of the first students in the Master's programme Media Technology and Production.
During my studies, I always had the goal of entering the professional world in the film-video field - e.g. as a video journalist. But as is so often the case, things turn out differently than planned. I started my career in the university world at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology via a part-time job during my studies at DIT. I was able to gain my first professional experience in the university administration in the area of studies and teaching. Most recently, I was responsible for setting up the central facilities for teaching and learning at the newly founded European Campus Rottal-Inn in Pfarrkirchen. Just as a side note: I used my part-time job at the university to develop a media and marketing concept for the Deggendorf Institute of Technology in my Master's thesis. After six years at DIT, however, it was time to get to know something new. Even though I lost a lot of dear colleagues in the process. Fortunately, I am still in close contact with many of the DIT staff - whom I would like to greet warmly at this point.
In the next chapter, I was allowed to accompany the development of the TUM Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability of the Technical University of Munich from the beginning in Straubing as a consultant for web design and marketing on the "green field". In addition to a web relaunch, I was responsible for student marketing, press and public relations, event management and web design at TUMCS.
For personal reasons, I then moved to Nuremberg. Professionally, I moved to the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt as a marketing officer and was responsible for the marketing of the Ingolstadt School of Management.
While working, I continued my education with an MBA in Business Management at the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, primarily to gain in-depth specialist knowledge in the field of management.
Not planned and by chance, I got the opportunity to manage and organise a constituency office of a member of the Bundestag as a research assistant in the German Bundestag at the beginning of 2022. Specifically, I take care of the organisation of appointments, the preparation and follow-up of appointments with citizens, companies, institutes or associations. I deal with concerns from the constituency and answer enquiries on a wide range of topics. This also includes press and public relations work, event management, writing speeches and speech texts or producing photos and videos for the social media channels of the Member of the Bundestag.

In addition to the excellent teaching and practical training, I particularly like to think back on the time spent alongside my studies. Compared to Nuremberg, Deggendorf is rather a small town, which I actually find optimal for a Bachelor's programme. This means that students always meet each other on campus or in the city. Everyone knows everyone. When I think of the parties at Yusuf or the 2006 World Cup in Germany.... That was a really great time, especially since beer still cost a good two euros back then :D. I was able to gather so many different experiences during my studies, I was able to try things out during my studies and I still benefit from the network I gained today. It was a really nice time at the campus on the beautiful blue Danube.
What advice would you give to today's students?
As a passionate former student advisor, I can only recommend one thing to you: You need a common thread or a goal, motivation, diligence, patience, stamina and you should always be open to new things. Try things out, sometimes go left, sometimes right, or even shift down a gear, but always keep your eyes firmly on the goal.
Looking back, I think it's a shame that there weren't so many options for international exchange programmes, for example, when I was a student. By the end of my studies and especially through my professional activities at the universities, I was able to build up an international network. The intercultural exchange, a new language, alone for a longer time abroad and without parents - these are experiences for life. That's why I encourage everyone to invest one or even two semesters in a semester abroad during their studies. Nowadays, there are so many programmes and funding opportunities for a stay abroad. Take advantage of this unique opportunity. Normally, you will never again have the opportunity to study abroad for so long and so "cheaply". And some people have found the love of their lives through this. That's why I've been commuting back and forth between Germany and Brazil regularly for a few years now.

Thankfully after completing my Master's degree at ECRI I was able to go back to Allm Inc. Dubai branch as a full-time trainee and hopefully a full time employee. It was the same organization I had carried out an internship with and that helped me to develop the Master thesis that I submitted. I am currently working as a Medical informatics specialist and hope to utilize the knowledge and skills I gained to help to provide the needed care to patients.
Remember your time at the ECRI: How was it studying there?
My time studying Medical Informatics at DIT European Campus Rottal-Inn has been a very educationally productive and enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend the program because I believe it can provide the student with the optimum learning experience that they seek. The program is well-designed to accommodate the current market development in Medical Informatics by providing knowledge that encompasses both theoretical and practical aspects which makes the overall experience standout.
What would you like to recommend to our current (MMI) students?
I enjoyed the numerous interactive and educational seminars and workshops by both the program lecturers and guest lecturers. Moreover, the program can provide the student with the best opportunity to interact with many other students and lecturers from diverse educational backgrounds and cultures that further enriches the experience. I wish all the best to future students in the Medical Informatics program.
Why should an international student study at ECRI?
My experience at ECRI has been truly amazing and educationally rewarding. I believe what truly makes ECRI so special is the well-defined education structure set down along with the hardworking and well-trained educational lecturers makes the education experience extraordinary. Moreover, the multinational diversity that is located in ECRI is amazing it exposed me to many different cultures and backgrounds that further developed my knowledge of the world.

As a practicing clinician, I was always interested in digital tools and their use in healthcare. This interest motivated me to look for newer horizons beyond clinical and academic dentistry. Graduating as Medical Informatics aka Digital Health graduate from ECRI, opened the pathway I always dreamt of – a career to witness and participate in innovation and technology use in healthcare. With the strongly rooted skills that I acquired during my studies in ECRI, I was ready to board this interesting new journey in my career. My current position revolves around selection and use of digital health tools, working with health systems data and development of innovative concepts and pipelines for the development of Machine Learning and AI-based tools with focus in the healthcare landscape.
Remember your time at the ECRI: How was it studying at Pfarrkirchen?
Even as time fades, the extravagant effect this city created in me still prevails. As first timer in Germany, this little city in Bavaria showed me warmth, hospitality and coziness that made me feel close to my home. I would say, Pfarrkirchen has the perfect balance between all that is needed to the studious type and to the partygoer. This homely atmosphere made me inculcate fast into the culture and tremendously helped to perform well in my studies. It is not only the city’s vibes, but also the culture at ECRI that helped me to excel and secure scholarships during my studies.
What would you like to recommend to our current (MMI) students?
The ‘family’ of MMI at ECRI has a reputation of supporting its students throughout the process of education, and through the process of gaining a position in your career. I preferred to use the word ‘FAMILY’ instead of ‘Faculty’, because that is way, I feel about my relationship with my MMI faculty. First, be assured that you are in safe hands, and always believe this is going to an interesting new journey. The journey will be worth the travel, and all along this journey it will be an excellent experience for all of us. The horizon after the completion of the course is also going to be bright, because this is best time to be in the field of digital health.
Why should an international student study at ECRI?
ECRI has large community of students, but relatively small enough for easier personal acquaintance. This community is mixed a populace - from local regions and abroad, giving you the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds and cultures. Personally, ECRI gave me the opportunity to discover myself while gaining an understanding of a different culture and tailored my ability to adapt to diverse situations while being able to problem solve. One of the most important things I acquired is my chance to gain my ‘once in my life experience’. Apart from studies, ECRI taught me to organize my life, handle unforeseen situations, be independent and self-sufficient.

I am an entrepreneur with all my heart. I've never had a job except for the mandatory internships. During my Business Administration studies in Deggendorf I founded my first company. But before that, I had already started working as a freelance advertising photographer. That's how I mainly financed my studies. After my studies, I specialised in e-commerce for a few years and learned a lot. Among other things I designed, built and operated the first online shop for the umbrella manufacturer Knirps based on my own idea. After about five years I sold the shop. Whether alone, with partners or for clients, I have managed to bring some e-commerce concepts to the market - with varying degrees of success, but this is clearly part of the learning process.
My network has grown considerably, which has also led to a role as a consultant for medium-sized companies in the areas of business development, marketing and innovation management. For one of my customers I found my current Indian colleagues at BlinkIn and commissioned them to program an app. We stayed in touch beyond the project and in 2018 they approached me to ask if we would like to develop a "digital pocket assistant" together.
A few weeks later, we started BlinkIn during my visit to India. Today, we are active with the Video Collaboration Platform in more than 40 countries, with customers from all over the world and lots more plans for BlinkIn! Recently, we helped a Bavarian company to install their ventilation systems in Wuhan from a distance. In Italy BlinkIn was also used to maintain the critical infrastructure. Currently, all signs at BlinkIn are pointing to growth. We are also looking for reinforcements for the areas AI and Computer Vision.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
I have fond memories of my student days. Especially during my Master's, the lectures were very discussion-heavy and therefore very entertaining. With 10 people in a seminar it is also difficult to duck away. I was able to take the necessary tools from my studies for my ventures.
At the same time, I like to think back to the time outside the lecture rooms! Although I did not live in Deggendorf, I hardly missed any events. I stayed in touch with many of my fellow students - among them are really clever people who get things going and with whom I regularly exchange ideas. In any case, my network has profited a lot from my studies in Deggendorf.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Setting goals, having fun, seizing opportunities! Make mistakes and learn from them. Do not take yourself too seriously and concentrate on the matter at hand. Observe all your life, listen and then do better. Build a strong network and generate value from this.
It doesn't matter what you have studied or in which field you are working - every day offers countless opportunities for people who are willing to consistently build up their own skills and use their energy for a goal at any time.
I can really only recommend to take the path to independence. The start-up community in Germany is growing, the general conditions are constantly improving, cooperation with larger companies is working very well  now- the world is open to a well-positioned start-up if we think and act in a customer-oriented manner.

Career Development
Since August 2022, I have been working as the Industrial Engineer responsible for technology at Zollner Elektronik AG at the Neukirchen b. Hl. Blut site. In this role, I am responsible for strategic technological development. This includes joint research projects, incidentally also with DIT as a research partner, project management for the procurement of equipment and various digitalisation projects. Through my studies in industrial engineering and the subsequent master‘s programme in technology management, I was able to create a sound knowledge base for my current tasks. What has my path looked like to date? I started my career in 2018, at that time still at Lindner Group SE. At the beginning, as a trainee in the Integrated Management Service (IMS) department. Here, I was able to work fully from the very beginning and was immediately perceived as a fully-fledged colleague. Already during the internship, my future area of responsibility, the support of all English subsidiaries of the group of companies, was formed. Immediately after my internship semester, I was able to take over and get full responsibility for this. In this function, it was my responsibility to audit and further develop the quality management systems according to ISO 9001:2015. The execution of these tasks included regular business trips, through which I was able to get to know a variety of inspiring personalities. I am particularly grateful for the friendships that have resulted. I worked at Lindner until I started my Master‘s degree (Technology Management).
In the course of my Master‘s degree, I took up a position as a working student in operational quality management at Zollner Elektronik AG in February 2020. As I was immediately able to impress everybody in the new environment, my contract was changed to a permanent position after just one month. As a result, I already had a permanent full-time position, with all the responsibilities, during my Master‘s degree. Due to the outbreak of the CoViD-19 pandemic, almost all face-to-face meetings were suddenly shifted to a virtual environment, which made it possible for me to dedicate myself to both my job and my studies at the same time. In the next two and a half years, I played a major role in building up the quality department at the Neukirchen b. Hl. Blut site. Here I was able to benefit greatly from my experience with quality management systems and introduce sustainable processes and the associated tools. Since the summer of 2022, I have been working in my current position as the industrial engineer responsible for technology.

It‘s mad how time flies! It seems like it was yesterday, my first semester day. It was almost eight years ago when I started my industrial engineering studies at DIT on the first of October 2015. Fresh out of school, I started my student life full of joy and diverse expectations. Yes, I look back fondly on my time at DIT, as it was marked by many unforgettable moments. unforgettable moments.
During the first semester, I was allowed to be a „buddy“ (supervisor) for international students, which was the foundation stone for my desire to also complete a semester abroad. When I think back to my time at DIT, I immediately think of my wonderful time in Finland. Everyone knows about sleepless nights during their studies. For me, it wasn‘t just Formula Student that was the source of such nights, but also the studies themselves and the student‘s evening activities that contributed to them in no small way. I now look back fondly on all the experiences and adventures I was able to have in connection with DIT.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Try your hand, get involved in all kinds of ways. There are so many opportunities to get involved at DIT. Be it one of the many university clubs, university sports or a semester abroad. Try out everything you feel like or are interested in. Think of your time at DIT as a big playground where you can discover your strengths, preferences or even your own personal passion. I can recommend one association in particular:
AlumniNet
. In my opinion, you should join this directly on Freshers‘ Day. Here, students from a wide variety of degree programmes and all semesters and graduation years come together. And the best thing is to stay in touch with the university after graduation. Speaking of staying in touch, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.

After graduating from high school in 2017, I really wanted to see the world and so I set off and ended up with the cruise ship fleet
Mein Schif
f from TUI Cruises GmbH. This was my first step towards tourism, and in 2018 I started studying tourism management at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology. During the semester breaks, I continued to remain loyal to the fleet and finally, with my studies in 2022, I went on board for the last time as a travel consultant, meanwhile a hotel officer. Since September 2022, my professional environment has changed completely. It was already clear to me during my studies, at the latest since Corona: I will not stay in tourism. So in September 2022 I started an internship at the BMW Austria GmbH Vienna branch in the HR department and have since been taken on there as an HR Specialist. At the only branch in Austria, my areas of expertise are sales for new cars, used cars and MINI, as well as administration and finance.
I also take care of local health management within BMW Austria GmbH in cooperation with Salzburg. From recruiting to personnel development and compensation and benefits, I get to take on a wide range of responsibilities.

Deggendorf is and remains a time I like to think back on! I met unbelievably great people with whom I still have a lot of contact today. I would also like to say a big THANK YOU for the support during my semester abroad in Chile during a really difficult time!
What advice would you give to today's students?
Although I didn't stay in the tourism industry, I can still benefit from a few topics. In my opinion, the degree programme is very varied and the specialisations in the last two semesters allow you to get to know completely different areas. Take every chance and use every opportunity to learn something new!

After graduating from high school in 2017, I started studying Tourism Management at DIT. I already had a few part-time jobs in the hotel and catering industry and really appreciated the sector, which is why the degree programme was just right for me. After completing my Bachelor's degree in the summer of 2021, I was able to start my professional life directly despite the pandemic and began working in the marketing department of a hotel. I have remained true to this area, although not in the tourism industry, but I can still benefit from a lot of the content of my studies and take a lot with me from my time in Deggendorf.

I always look back on my time at DIT with great pleasure. I met so many great people there, and I still keep in touch with them even after my studies are over. Deggendorf has an incomparable charm, which is why I will continue to enjoy visiting the small town and indulging in nostalgia.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Don't let it get you down! There are always semesters or study contents that don't suit you personally. But if you are passionate about what you are doing, sticking with it will be 100% worth it and you won't want to miss your time in Deggendorf :)

I finished in the middle of the 2021 pandemic and the job market looked correspondingly bad. Nevertheless, I landed a hit and found a job in management consultancy as a marketing and project assistant. In the meantime, however, I found that I was drawn back to the tourism and events industry, so I started looking for a new challenge and luckily landed with my current employer. I recently started working in event management at Bayern Innovativ GmbH in Nuremberg. I've enjoyed the work so much since then and I'm glad I took the plunge and started looking again.

I really miss studying on campus! Especially the location directly on the Danube often made it possible for us to have nice coffee breaks, relaxed afternoons and even the odd party there. I also liked the fact that at DIT you are not just a number, you know each other.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Don't let the pandemic get you down, there are now so many great and new opportunities in the tourism industry. Don't let it get you down if your first degree or job doesn't turn out as expected, but find out what suits you best and where you feel most comfortable.

My professional career is probably not the 0815 path you'd expect, because I already worked during my bachelor's degree. In addition to my tourism management studies, I had a permanent part-time job as a flight attendant. One or two times I also sat in my uniform in the lecture. But in the end, everything worked out great and I managed to combine both. After my Bachelor's degree, I decided to get out of the tourism industry a bit and am studying for a Master of Sciences in Marketing and Branding at the University of Innsbruck. What the next step will be is still written in the stars...
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
I associate my time at DIT with a lot of fun - except for the 3 week exam period, haha. Deggendorf is more like a village, as the name suggests, but there's always something going on because of the many students. Besides, how cool is it to be able to do everything on foot or by bike? Or accidentally seeing lots of familiar faces when you leave?
But the familiar atmosphere at the university was particularly special for me. I am still in contact with some of the professors and staff.
What advice would you give to today's students?
I think that's my tip: use your time at the university to make contacts, get to know different people and their lives, and realise what opportunities are open to you. It is important to take advantage of opportunities and try things out, and this is made easy at the DIT (AdA certificate, team-building seminars, etc.).

After my training as a tourism management assistant, I studied tourism management at DIT with the intention of later working in city marketing. Instead, after graduating, I ended up in a Hamburg start-up that programmed software for tourism companies. That's how I ended up in IT and today I work as a technical project manager in a marketing agency. An essential part of my work is team-internal consultation with developers, conceptual designers and designers, but also close contact with clients. In my case with Magnum, Knorr and individual departments of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection.

Fischer-WG <3 The semester abroad was definitely the best experience during my studies, I would do it again any time.
What advice would you give to today's students?
I no longer work in tourism, but I can work from anywhere in the world. That's why my recommendation: Don't take the first offer that comes along, but look around to see what else is out there. And don't sell yourself short! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn, Facebook or Instagram :)

After an excursion into the Austrian hotel industry, I received a job offer in my home town of Berchtesgaden. For more than 3 years I was responsible for the development of the entire marketing in a mountain railway company and was able to establish contacts in the entire mountain railway, tourism and winter sports industry up to the highest committees. Nevertheless, it has always been my dream to build up my own business, which I did in 2021. I run my own online shop for fashion accessories. At the moment I'm concentrating on e-commerce, but "you never know", maybe I'll even open a store in Deggendorf one day.

I decided to study tourism at DIT after graduating from high school because the programme sounded versatile and very lively and practical to me. Already during my studies, I gained my first experience in the hotel industry and subsequently joined the fields of occupational safety and human resources management.
Later, I also worked in the field of data protection, which allowed me to gain a lot of experience in the organisation and implementation of training courses as well as the development and conception of management systems - all in the context of the hotel industry and leisure pool sector.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
Visits to the ITB (International Tourism Exchange) in Berlin, participation in tourism-related events and being involved in the student council. Of course, also fellow students from the A faculty and the degree programme!
What advice would you give to today's students?
Don't be overwhelmed by the variety of study offers, but always be aware that there is no longer one typical career path today. Take advantage of the test offers from the universities and try out the right path for you - both in terms of the degree programme and the training model. It's best to choose the path that feels best for you and that allows you to grow sustainably and healthily - earnings should also play a role, but first and foremost you have to feel comfortable with your decision. If you have any questions or are interested, I would also be happy to hear from you personally - for example by networking on Xing or LinkedIn. 😊
Theresa Troglauer
2015 | Tourismusmanagement
Career Development
I gained my first professional experience before and during my studies in various internships and part-time jobs. After my Bachelor's degree, I ended up in sales in the hotel industry - the fascination for the hotel industry was my original motivation for studying tourism management - and first acquired (corporate) customers, planned events and negotiated framework agreements for an individual hotel and later for a small privately managed hotel chain with mainly business hotels. After the takeover of this hotel chain by a larger operating company, I was responsible for and managed the sales division "MICE & Business Groups" (MICE = Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, Events) for about 100 hotels. As we all know, the Covid 19 pandemic hit the city and conference hotel industry particularly hard, so I used the time to study for a Master's degree. In the meantime, I got the opportunity to help build up the sales operations division of a tech start-up and implement my first projects as a freelancer.
Today, I support and advise hotels and other tourism businesses, especially on the topics of MICE, sales and digitalisation. In addition, I have been able to pass on my practical experience as a lecturer to the next TM students at DIT for several semesters.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
When I think back to my time as a DIT student, I think of three points in particular:
1. the familiar and international atmosphere on campus - international might sound unusual for the small town of Deggendorf, but the worldwide partner universities from which students come to Deggendorf and where you can spend a semester abroad relatively easily (I spent a semester in Lima, Peru, for example) make sure of that;
2. lots of contact with companies, industry representatives and
alumni
, e.g. at lectures, theme days, at the ITB (the largest tourism trade fair in Berlin) or excursions organised by profs and/or DEG.TOUR.-S. (tourism students' association);
3. numerous activities (and of course parties 😉) organised by the many different DIT associations, where you can get involved yourself and thus also come into contact with other degree programmes quite easily.
What advice would you give to today's students?
Try out new things and gain experience! The tourism industry and related sectors are so large and varied, offering exciting opportunities from regional to global, from family businesses to start-ups to global corporations, from guest services to back-office services such as marketing, HR or finance to strategic and conceptual activities - there really is something for everyone. It helps me a lot to have tried out completely new areas that I knew less about before. And the degree programme is the best opportunity for that.
The tourism industry is a village (yes, even though it is so big and versatile). You always meet familiar faces and everyone knows everyone else through a few corners. Start building your own network early on - social networks (e.g. LinkedIn) also help - you never know when you might need a contact.
And of course: just enjoy your time at university!
Sebastian Roth
2012 | Tourism Management
Career Development
After graduating from high school, I first did my civilian service in my hometown. Since I have always been enthusiastic about flying, I dared to take part in the pilot assessment centre at Lufthansa.
However, this plan fell through after the first round, so I started looking for suitable alternatives and quickly became aware of the Tourism Management degree programme and the university town of Deggendorf. Somewhere I had read that a pre-study internship was an advantage, so I really got out for the first time and spent the three months between my civilian service and the start of my studies with a small tour operator in Zanzibar - ultimately the beginning of a smaller journey and personal development. During my studies in Deggendorf, I spent my semester abroad in Peru and my internship in Mexico.
Afterwards, I did a double Master's degree in International Product & Service Management in Ansbach and Valencia before I ended up at Munich Airport for my Master's thesis. Funny coincidence: a fellow student from Deggendorf was working at the airport in the meantime and played the door opener. This is also where I found my first permanent job in the Business Development department of AeroGround, an operating subsidiary of the airport.
Two years later, for love's sake, I went into exile in Hesse and have since worked in various functions at Condor. I am currently head of OPS Performance and, among other things, I am responsible for replacing our long-haul aircraft with modern and fuel-efficient models.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
The time in Deggendorf is definitely one of the most beautiful and formative of my life. I really enjoyed both the semesters in Bavaria and my stays abroad. Close friendships developed during my studies, which we still maintain despite the distance.
Since I met my current wife during my studies, we naturally have something very special in common with Deggendorf. So we always stop by for a pint on campus every now and then.
What advice would you give to today's students?
A lot of things are much easier in university than in professional life, so enjoy your time at university to the fullest. And above all, get out of your comfort zone: go abroad by all means, and as often as you can!
Gloria Pietta
2011 | Tourism Management
Career Development
After my training as a state-certified translator, I wanted to have an additional qualification in order to be able to orient myself a little more broadly in my career later on.
Tourism Management turned out to be just the right thing for me. The degree programme covers a broad spectrum of learning content and thus offers the possibility of orienting oneself in all areas after graduation, be it in tourism, in the trade fair business, in the hotel industry or in the free economy in general. The opportunity to complete both a semester abroad and an internship abroad should definitely be taken advantage of, because the selection of partner universities at DIT is excellent.
I did an internship abroad in Barcelona - at the subsidiary of Messe München. Not only did I improve my language skills enormously, but I also learned a lot about business processes in the trade fair industry and about working in another country. I then wrote my Bachelor's thesis at IMAG, the International Trade Fair and Exhibition Company, a subsidiary of Messe München.
Nevertheless, I didn't end up in the trade fair business after graduating, but initially in international university marketing at DIT, where I worked for the International Office. I even had a teaching position there for Business English for Master's students.
After three years, I wanted to reorient myself and switched to PLAYMOBIL. There I was Area Manager for Asia Pacific. Here I was able to apply the knowledge I had acquired during my studies and establish myself very well.
Since the end of my parental leave, I have been working in marketing at PLAYMOBIL, where I am responsible for "Licensing Out" - I am the interface, so to speak, for companies that want to publish certain products in the publishing sector on behalf of Playmobil.
Reminiscing allowed: remember your student days
I always have fond memories of my time in Deggendorf. I felt incredibly comfortable there and found a great circle of friends. The DIT was and is a very good university, and the advice I received about my studies was very personal and results-oriented.
What advice would you give to today's students?
My advice: By all means take the opportunity and go abroad! You have to get out of your comfort zone sometimes to be able to broaden your horizons! So I would choose this degree programme again at any time. :)

the dit experience - celebrating interculturalism
Since we were established more than 29 years ago, we have focused on internationality and interculturalism. We maintain partnerships with 200
universities
worldwide, and each semester we welcome around 150
exchange students
from all over the world, who enjoy perfect conditions for their participation in the
Erasmus+
programme. The modular structure of our English-language exchange programmes
General Engineering
,
General Business
and
International Computer Science
allow the academic requirements of a semester abroad to be tailored to the individual needs of each exchange student. Extracurricular activities from the International Office and the
Erasmus Student Network ESN club
, complete the agenda to make a semester abroad at DIT an unforgettable experience.
Our faculties welcome
international degree-seeking students
in
all degree programmes
. DIT has the largest range of English-language degree programmes in Bavaria, with the
European Campus Rottal-Inn
in Pfarrkirchen being the only campus in Bavaria to host all lectures exclusively in English. The proportion of international students in German-language degree programmes is also impressive: a total of almost 45% of DIT students come from over 100 countries around the world to study in
Deggendorf
,
Pfarrkirchen
or
Cham
. In "
Let's get Started
" prep semester, international applicants can acquire all the necessary language qualifications to successfully complete a German-language degree programme. So intercultural contacts are part of everyday life here, and intercultural skills can be acquired in daily life at any of our campuses.
Our students who want to
go abroad
benefit from a wide range of support, whether they choose to complete study, an internship, or attend a summer school abroad.
Furthermore, professors and support staff can benefit from international exchange within the framework of staff mobility. International guest lecturers enrich teaching in all subjects, as do international workshops and projects organised at DIT's research-intensive technology campuses. Speaking of
research
: we are Bavaria's most research-intensive university of applied science with projects far outreaching the local region.
International students become international alumni,
DIT alumni
are sought-after employees in companies worldwide. The transition from student to professional working life is effortless thanks to the good support of the Career Service. The domestic alumni network accompanies alumni on their way abroad and provides support through programmes such as
international mentoring
or the international ambassador programme (in 2022).
DIT is home to the
Bavaria-Malaysia Coordination Office (COBM)
, which centrally supports the German-language studies of Malaysian scholarship holders in Bavaria.
Last but not least, our
Language Centre
teaches students necessary skills - namely a higher level of efficiency in several foreign languages.
Choosing Deggendorf means choosing the world.
